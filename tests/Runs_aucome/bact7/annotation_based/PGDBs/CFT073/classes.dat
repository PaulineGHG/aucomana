COMMON-NAME - All Pathways and Reactions
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.

COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - A group of frames, usually all of the same class, that are associated together in a single logical collection.  This is a utility class -- its only slot of its own is group-members.  Each of its subclasses will define a type of collection, and specify the class of frames that can be members.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cell-Types
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is used to distinguish between different types of cells within a single organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Products
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is a subclass of Frames because it does not make sense for it to be a subclass of anything else,
COMMENT - because Pseudo-Products do not actually exist.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, it contains only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been
/assigned.  To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Conditions
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe the environmental conditions under which some set of data was collected.  These instances can be supplied as the value of the CONDITIONS
/annotation for environment-specific slots such as TRANSCRIPT-COPY-NUMBER.  The growth conditions that can be specified include temperature, pH, aerobicity, growth-media
/and gene knockouts (although the wildtype organism is assumed by default).  Any description of environmental conditions that cannot be captured via these slots should be
/described using the COMMENT slot. It is not necessary to specify a growth-status.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Non-Defined-Mixtures

COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical transformation of some type.  It
/may involve small molecules or macromolecules.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Biomass-Compositions
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.
/The biomass set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a polymer segment enzyme substrate
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Media
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - A growth medium is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/The set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the
/corresponding protein.  Relevant regulatory mechanisms include those that directly interfere with or facilitate the translation process,
/as well as those involving processing of the mRNA transcript to promote or inhibit its degradation before translation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathways
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Pathways
COMMENT - This class is the root of a classification hierarchy for metabolic
/pathways.  Its subclasses divide pathways into groups
/based on their biological functions, and based on the classes
/of metabolites that they produce and/or consume.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compounds-And-Elements
TYPES - Chemicals
COMMON-NAME - a small molecule or an element
COMMENT - This class allows us to index compounds and elements together.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Macromolecules
TYPES - Chemicals
COMMON-NAME - a macromolecule
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

SYNONYMS - GO:0044699
SYNONYMS - biological process
SYNONYMS - physiological process
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.
//
UNIQUE-ID - GO:0003674
TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - molecular_function
SYNONYMS - GO:0005554
SYNONYMS - molecular function
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

COMMON-NAME - cellular_component
SYNONYMS - GO:0008372
SYNONYMS - cell or subcellular entity
SYNONYMS - cellular component
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Subatomic-Particles

COMMON-NAME - a subatomic particle
COMMENT - This class holds subatomic particles, such as an electron and a proton.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (e.g. glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and TCA cycle pathways), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Degradation
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation
SYNONYMS - Assimilation
SYNONYMS - Utilization
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms degrade substrates to serve as sources of nutrients and energy, utilize exogenous sources of essential metabolites, or assimilate certain sources of essential bioelements.   
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biosynthesis
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Biosynthesis
COMMENT - This class contains pathways that constitute a cell's complete spectrum of biosynthetic capacities, including the routes of synthesis of small molecules, macromolecules and cell structure components.
/When applicable, salvage pathways are included as well.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Macromolecule-Modification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Macromolecule Modification
COMMENT - This class holds pathways that describe modifications of pre-existing large macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement to experimental support
COMMENT - Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IGI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from genetic interaction
COMMENT - IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> "Traditional" genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.
/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,
/process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B
/using IGI).

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IMP
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from mutant phenotype
COMMENT - IMP inferred from mutant phenotype.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as
/<ul>
/    <li> Any gene mutation/knockout
/    <li> Overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant genes
/    <li> Anti-sense experiments
/    <li> RNA interference experiments
/    <li> Specific protein inhibitors
/    <li> Complementation
/</ul><p>	
/Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or
/abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP
/(compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies 
/or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no
/gene may be mutated (the rationale is that EV-IMP is used where an
/abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).

//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IDA
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from direct assay
COMMENT - IDA inferred from direct assay.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a direct experimental assay such as
/<ul>

/    <li> In vitro reconstitution (e.g. transcription)
/    <li> Immunofluorescence
/    <li> Cell fractionation

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IPI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from physical interaction
COMMENT - IPI inferred from physical interaction<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a physical interaction such as

/    <li> 2-hybrid interactions
/    <li> Co-purification
/    <li> Co-immunoprecipitation
/    <li> Ion/protein binding experiments
/</ul><p>
/This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of
/interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such
/as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is
/simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay
/directly detects the binding. For both IPI and IGI, it would be good
/practice to qualify them with the gene/protein/ion.

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-HTP-HGI
TYPES - EV-HTP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from high throughput genetic interaction
COMMENT - The HGI evidence code is used for annotations based on high throughput experiments reporting the effects of perturbations in the sequence or expression of one or more genes or gene products. HGI is also used for high throughput experiments that interrogate functional interactions between two or more genes or gene products when co-expressed, for example, in a cell line. Additional uses of HGI include high throughput experiments in which the expression of one gene affects the phenotypic outcome of a mutation in another gene.
/
/The HGI evidence code requires curators enter a stable database identifier for the interacting entity in the With/From field of the Gene Association File (GAF). Independent interactors may be captured in the With/From field by separating each entry with a pipe. If the interaction experiment involves multiple perturbations simultaneously, e.g. triply mutant strains, then the respective interactors are separated with a comma.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-HTP-HMP
TYPES - EV-HTP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from high throughput mutant phenotype

//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-HTP-HDA
TYPES - EV-HTP

TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Author hypothesis
COMMENT - Author hypothesis. The hypothesis is in a publication, but it was clearly indicated in the

/hypothesis. This code can be used, for example, for "paper chemistry" metabolic pathways, 
/which are pathways drawn from the author's best estimation.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Fragments
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMON-NAME - Gene-Fragments
COMMENT - This class is used when a single gene or pseudogene is made up of
/multiple fragments that are not adjacent on the chromosome.  Examples
/of when the use of gene-fragments is called for include a) when a
/pseudogene has been interrupted by one or more insertion elements so
/now comprises multiple non-contiguous segments, b) when a significant
/section of DNA (containing other genes) is excised before
/transcription, and a single transcript is produced from non-contiguous
/DNA segments, and c) to represent trans-splicing.  Gene fragment
/objects should NOT be created when a) a deletion results in a
/pseudogene that is nonfunctional because it is missing a portion of
/the gene, but still comprises a single segment (create this as a
/regular pseudogene instead), b) a gene product results from splicing
/together multiple exons within a single contiguous gene (use the
/CODING-SEGMENTS slot to represent that case instead), or c) when a
/gene or pseudogene contains an internal frame-shift or stop codon but
/still logically comprises a single contiguous extent of DNA.
/
/The sequence of a gene composed of Gene-Fragments is a concatenation
/of the sequences of all its fragments in the specified order (using
/their left-end-position and right-end-position slots, and
/reverse-complemented before concatenation if the gene is on the
/reverse strand). If a gene has Gene-Fragments, then the
/left-end-position and right-end-position slots of that gene must be
/empty.  Gene-Fragments cannot have Gene-Fragments of their own.  Each
/Gene-Fragment must have its own transcription-direction, in order to
/be able to represent cases of trans-splicing in which different
/fragments are on different strands.

UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Reactions Classified By Conversion Type
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified by the type of 
/transition that occurs, whether by a change in covalent bonding, by a  weak binding interaction,
/or via a complex multistep process, etc.  This reaction ontology is orthogonal to the classification 
/of reactions by substrate classes, that is, many reactions will have parents in both ontologies.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

COMMON-NAME - a protein
SYNONYMS - Protein

//
UNIQUE-ID - Replicon-Buckets
TYPES - DNA-Segments
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Binding-Sites
TYPES - mRNA-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines regions on mRNA transcripts to which other objects, such as regulatory proteins or complementary sRNAs, bind.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

COMMON-NAME - Inferred from Biological aspect from Ancestor
COMMENT - A type of phylogenetic evidence whereby an aspect of a descendent is inferred through the characterization of an aspect of a ancestral gene.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Translation-Exceptions
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - This class records variations of the protein sequence due to a translation exception,
/which are marked as such in genome annotation files.  The common case involves one codon,
/for which the translation incorporates an unexpected amino acid.  The canonical example
/is the stop codon TGA, which in a few cases can be used for Sec (selenocysteine).
/
/However, there also exist codons, for which the replacement has been labeled 'OTHER'.
/In these cases, it seems unclear what to do, and these usually occur in proteins
/labeled as 'low quality'.
/                
/When a protein sequence is generated, this class is consulted, to incorporate replacement
/amino acids in the correct location.  To make such a single position replacement work correctly,
/the same integer has to be stored in the feature frame's LEFT-END-POSITION and RIGHT-END-POSITION
/slots, and the ALTERNATE-SEQUENCE should contain the 1-letter string for the replacement aa code.

UNIQUE-ID - Zn-Finger-Regions
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is
/a limited and local parallel of DNA and protein sequences, the occurrence of the
/contacting amino acid residues in the protein sequence falls into a regularity, or
/register, that creates in the protein a syllabicity. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Signal-Sequences
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - The N-terminal portion of a secretory or membrane protein that assists it
/across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
/synthesized, but is cleaved from the protein even before the synthesis of the

/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Respiration
TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMENT - This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
/both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a
/source of energy.
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

UNIQUE-ID - Allosteric-Regulation-of-RNAP
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation by an alarmone, which is produced by the cell under conditions of stress.  The alarmone
/binds to RNA-Polymerase, changing its promoter preference, and thus regulating transcription initiation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.

UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//

/only approximately are assigned to the subclasses ORFs and Unclassified-Genes,
/respectively.  GO (Gene Ontology) assignments are implemented using the

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Cluster-Chaperones
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis chaperone]
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Pathogenicity-Islands
TYPES - Genomic-Islands
COMMENT - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are a class of genomic islands that are present in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms, but are usually absent from non-pathogenic
/organisms of the same or closely related species.  They contain genes that code for one or more virulence factors, such as adhesins, toxins, invasins, etc.  PAIs are discrete genetic units flanked by direct repeats, insertion sequences or tRNA genes, which are sites for recombination into the DNA.   They can be transferred as a single unit to new cells, thus conferring virulence to formerly benign strains.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Phantom-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Phantom genes are regions of DNA that were once thought to be genes
/(such as because they were identified as genes by a computational

COMMENT - An IS element is a short DNA sequence that acts as a transposable element, meaning
/it can change its position within the genome.  IS elements are small relative to other
/transposable elements, and they code only for proteins (e.g., transposases) involved in transposition
/activity.  When IS elements occur in the middle of genes, they interrupt the coding
/sequence and inactivate the gene.  IS elements can also block the expression of
/other genes within the same operon.

UNIQUE-ID - REP-Elements
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - A Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) element is a short base pair sequence capable of producing a stem-loop structure.  REP elements
/are located in different orientations and arrays between genes within an operon or at the end of an operon.  They are always found
/outside of structural genes.  Groups of REP elements are also known as BIMEs (bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements).  The actual function of these
/elements is unclear.  They may act as mRNA stabilizers, targets for DNA gyrase binding, or hot spots for transposition and recombination events.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Pseudo genes are regions of DNA that show sequence similarity to other functional genes, but that
/are not in fact functional genes.   A pseudogene might be nonfunctional because of sequence
/changes that prevent its transcription or translation, such as by disrupting its promoter
/or by introducing a premature stop codon.

SYNONYMS - a nitrile
COMMENT - Nitriles are <b>organic</b> compounds that contain a functional group of a carbon atom linked by a triple bond to a nitrogen atom (known as a cyano group). Inorganic compounds that contain the cyano group are not called nitriles, but cyanides.
/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.

/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on

UNIQUE-ID - AEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Aerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/
/This class, which stands for aerobic respiration, contains pathways through
/which electrons flow from various organic and inorganic electron donors to

COMMON-NAME - suberin
COMMENT - Suberin is a polymeric plant cell wall constituent mainly found in the epidermal tissues of underground plant parts. Suberin consists of two domains, a polyaromatic ((poly)hydroxycinnamate domain) and a polyaliphatic domain. The polyaromatics are predominately located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the primary cell wall and the plasmalemma. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. 
/
/The |FRAME: PWY-1121 biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin monomers| shares the same upstream reactions with |FRAME: PWY-321|, and the biosynthesis of suberin aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with lignin biosynthesis. Although both suberin and cutin contain aliphatic monomers, suberin differs from cutin by the chain length of aliphatic monomers, which can range from C16 to C32. 
/
/Some of the major suberin monomers include |FRAME: 18-HYDROXYOLEATE|, |FRAME: OCTADEC-9-ENE-118-DIOIC-ACID|, and |FRAME: CPD-440|, characterized in potato, as well as very long chain aliphatic monomers found in many plants. In addition, |FRAME: 16-HYDROXYPALMITATE| is a precursor of an important component of aromatic suberin in Arabidopsis  |CITS:[19759341][19846769]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Estrogens
TYPES - Hormones
COMMON-NAME - an estrogen
COMMENT - Estrogens are hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics in mammals by binding to estrogen receptors. They are important in both the menstrual and the estrous reproductive cycles.
/
/Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects, suggesting that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. The estrogens that occur naturally in the body are steroids, however other types of molecules acquired in the diet are known to bind to the estrogen receptors and are thus also considered estrogens. They include molecules produced by plants (phytoestrogens), molecules produced by fungi (mycoestrogens), and synthetic compounds (xenoestrogens).

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

UNIQUE-ID - Manumycins
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a manumycin
COMMENT - The manumycins are a unique group of epoxyquinone natural products. Since their discovery in 1963 |CITS: [14208615]|, more than 30 manumycin-related natural products have been reported |CITS: [9652122]|. They all share a common structural skeleton with a 2-amino-4-hydroxyl-5,6-epoxycyclohex-2-enone (mC7N) core. They differ in the nature of the acyl side chain on the amino nitrogen (known as the upper side chain) and the acyl side chain at the C4 position (the lower side chain).
/Even though there is variability in the composition of the lower chain, it is always terminated by a 2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (C5N) moiety.
/
/In addition to antibacterial, anticoccidial, and antifungal activities |CITS: [9652122]|, manumycin compounds display strong inhibitory activities against |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.58| |CITS: [8460134][17363690]|, |FRAME: EC-3.4.22.36| |CITS: [8982335]|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.10| |CITS: [16319058]|, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.7| |CITS: [17373546]|, and thus are drug candidates to treat cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and Alzheimer disease |CITS: [23890006]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Dithiopyrrolones
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a dithiopyrrolone
SYNONYMS - a pyrrolinonodithiole
COMMENT - Dithiolopyrrolone group antibiotics are characterized by an electronically unique bicyclic structure, which contains a compact disulfide bridge between two ene-thiols. The dithiolopyrrolones exhibit very broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and potent antiangiogenic effects |CITS: [24835149]|.
/
/The family comprises more than 25 natural variants, isolated from a variety of soil and marine-derived bacteria, including both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. The earliest dithiopyrrolone to be reported was |FRAME: CPD-17938|, which was isolated from a strain of |FRAME: TAX-37329| (referred to as <i>Actinomyces farcinicus</i> in the original paper) in 1948 |CITS: [Umezawa48]|.

COMMON-NAME - a calmodulin
//
UNIQUE-ID - Dapdiamides
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a dapdiamide
COMMENT - This family of antibiotics, discovered in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-549|, consists of fumaramoyl and epoxysuccinamoyl dipeptides. It is named for the presence of |FRAME: 23-Diaminopropanoate| (DAP) and two amide linkages in the antibiotic scaffold |CITS: [20041689]|.
/
/The compounds are similar in structure to synthetic |FRAME: CPD0-1236| dipeptides, which show broad spectrum activity by targeting bacterial and fungal |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.16|, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the formation of the essential cell-wall building block |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| |CITS: [2111163][1901701]|.
/
/These compounds are likely cleaved intracellularly to generate acyl-DAP warheads that interact with the enzyme. The fumaramoyl-DAP warheads which would be derived from |FRAME: CPD-18311|, |FRAME: CPD-17539|, |FRAME: CPD-17540|, |FRAME: CPD-17541| and |FRAME: CPD-17542| provide a conjugated eneamide system that is likely attacked by the thiolate side chain of the active site Cys in the glutaminase domain of the enzyme, leading to alkylation of that residue, preventing the formation of ammonium essential of enzyme activity |CITS: [2111163]|. The epoxysuccinamoyl moiety in |FRAME: CPD-18309|, |FRAME: CPD-18310|, and |FRAME: CPD-17543| could function as a similar inactivating electrophile for the catalytic Cys residue |CITS: [19807062]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Tetrahydroisoquinolines
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a tetrahydroisoquinoline antibiotic
COMMENT - Antibiotics belonging to the |FRAME: Tetrahydroisoquinolines tetrahydroisoquinoline| class have been isolated from various soil bacteria as well as some marine invertebrates such as sponges and ascidians, where they are most likely produced by symbiotic bacteria. These antibiotics exhibit remarkable antitumor activity and share several common structural features |CITS: [11996547]|.
/
/Some of the compounds included in this class are |FRAME: CPD-16513| |CITS: [567065]|, |FRAME: CPD-18026| |CITS: [16314293]|, |FRAME: CPD-18027| |CITS: [7174530]| and |FRAME: CPD-18028| |CITS: [6860429]|. Among them, |FRAME: CPD-18026| exhibits the most potent antitumor activity and has been approved as an anticancer drug for use in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma |CITS: [25273374]|.

COMMENT - Polymyxins are antibiotics with a general structure consisting of a cyclic peptide with a long hydrophobic tail. They disrupt the structure of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids. 
/
/Polymyxins are produced by the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME:TAX-1406| and are selectively toxic for Gram-negative bacteria due to their specificity for the lipopolysaccharide molecules that exist within many Gram-negative outer membranes.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Aurachins
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - an aurachin
COMMENT - Aurachin alkaloids were originally isolated from the myxobacterium |FRAME: TAX-675526| in the 1980s |CITS: [3106289]|. They are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration through blockage of NADH oxidation, presumably because of their significant structural similarity to |FRAME: Menaquinones menaquinone| |CITS: [7827023][20335999]|. |FRAME: CPD-7733 "Aurachin C"| is a particularly effective inhibitor of the two terminal oxidases of |FRAME: TAX-562|, |FRAME: CYT-O-UBIOX-CPLX "cytochromes <i>bo</i>"| and |FRAME: CYT-D-UBIOX-CPLX "cytochrome <i>bd</i>"|, whereas |FRAME: CPD-15909| displays a selectivity for inhibition of cytochrome <i>bd</i> |CITS: [7827023]|.
/
/Beside |FRAME: TAX-40|, only one other producer species has been discovered - the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1833|, which produces |FRAME: CPD-15906| |CITS: [19168983]|. Despite the fact that these two organisms are phylogenetically unrelated, the genes that encode the biosyntheric enzymes share some similarity |CITS: [23677853]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Melleolides
TYPES - Antibiotics
COMMON-NAME - a melleolide
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Melleolides melleolides| are a large family of aryl ester secondary metabolites produced by species of the basidiomycete genus |FRAME: TAX-47424|, which are composed of an |FRAME: CPD-47| moiety esterified to a tricyclic sesquiterpene (|FRAME: CPD-14796|) alcohol |CITS: [Midland82][Donnelly82]|. Both |FRAME: CPD-47| and protoilludane derivatives have been described from numerous other organisms |CITS: [11281843][12714063][19666480]|, but these two elements are combined into a single entity only in the melleolides, which are not found outside the |FRAME: TAX-47424|. 
/
/Biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene protoilludene moiety is achieved by cyclization of |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP|, catalyzed
/by |FRAME: EC-4.2.3.135|, and results in the tricyclic |FRAME: CPD-14796| backbone |CITS: [21148562]|. In |FRAME: TAX-47429|, |FRAME: CPD-47| is biosynthesized by a seven-domain polyketide synthase whose terminal thioesterase domain also catalyzes the coupling of |FRAME: CPD-47| to protoilludene-based alcohols |CITS: [23993460]|. Modifications of the basic structure include hydroxylation at various positions of the sesquiterpene, oxidation of the primary alcohol at C-1 to an aldehyde or carboxy group, shift or reduction of the cyclohexene double bond, methyl ether formation at O-5', and chlorination at C-6' |CITS: [26655762]|, resulting in excess of 60 melleolide analogs and making the melleolides one of the most diverse groups of fungal natural products |CITS: [Misiek12]|.
/
/Various melleolides have been shown to inhibit microbial growth |CITS: [Arnone86][10805573]| and display phytotoxicity |CITS: [1418682]|.  The antifungal activity has been linked to the position of the double bond within the sesquiterpene moiety |CITS: [24906293]|. Melleolides have also been reported to have cytotoxic effects on human cancer cell lines by decreasing DNA synthesis |CITS: [21376582]|.

/
/Tirandamycins inhibit the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), and inhibit both chain initiation and chain elongation |CITS: [791108]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-18214 "Tirandamycin A"| was first isolated from the terrestrial bacterium |FRAME: ORG-6282| |CITS: [5092790]|, and its absolute stereochemistry was determined by X-ray diffraction shortly after |CITS: [4710070]|.
/
/Tirandamycin A and its other congeners |FRAME: CPD-18216|, |FRAME: CPD-18217|, and |FRAME: CPD-18218| were later reisolated or discovered from |FRAME: TAX-67297| |CITS: [962473]|, the marine-derived |FRAME: TAX-529089| |CITS: [19883065]|, and |FRAME: TAX-861528|, which was isolated from South China Sea marine sediment.

They are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic types, depending on whether they are derived from methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan. Indolylmethyl glucosinolates are found mainly in leaves. For a review, see |CITS: [12049923]|.
/
/Glucosinolates are stored in the vacuole and come into contact with the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.147| (myrosinase) upon breakage of the cell. Myrosinase de-glucosylates the glucosinolates, resulting in formation of nitriles, isothiocyanates and thiocyanates. The precise product that is formed depends on the glucosinolate and whether an epithiospecifier protein is present. 
/
/The breakdown products give the typical sharp taste and odor to many of the members of brassicaceae that are eaten, such as raddish and mustard. Arabidopsis has been shown to accumulate at least 23 different glucosinolates in both seeds and leaves.

UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxin
TYPES - Flavoproteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.
/
/Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

UNIQUE-ID - Cardiac-Glycosides
TYPES - Steroids
COMMON-NAME - a cardiac glycoside
COMMENT - Cardiac glycosides are plant-made compounds (mostly by members of the |FRAME: TAX-4163| genus, or Foxgloves) that have beneficial effects over patients with cardiac failure. The treatment of congestive heart failure (dropsy), among other ailments like tuberculosis, by the use of Foxglove is mentioned in writings as early as 1250 A. D., when the Welsh Physicians of Myddva collected foxglove as one of their many herbs and included it in their remedies. |CITS: [28561136]|.
/
/The cardiac glycosides are composed of two structural features: a sugar moiety that may contain one or more saccharides, and a steroid aglycone. Cardiac glycosides having a terminal glucose are called primary glycosides whereas those lacking such a sugar are termed secondary glycosides.
/
/There are two classes of cardiac glycosides differing by the group attached at the 17-position of the aglycone: the |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolides"|, which have a five-membered unsaturated lactone ring (but-2-en-4-olide ring) and the |FRAME: Bufadienolide-Glycosides bufadienolides|, which have a six membered doubly unsaturated lactone ring (penta-2,4-dien-5-olide ring).
/
/The steroid nucleus of the cardiac glycosides have a unique configuration: rings A/B and C/D are <i>cis</i>- fused while rings B/C are <i>trans</i>- fused. The nucleus has &beta; configured hydroxyls at the positions C-3 and C-14, and many compounds have additional hydroxyl groups at positions 12 and 16. The sugars found in the glycoside moiety range from common hexoses and pentoses (such as |FRAME: D-Glucose|, |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE|, and |FRAME: D-Xylose|) to very uncommon sugars, some of which have only been found in cardiac glycosides (e.g. |FRAME: D-quinovopyranose|, |FRAME: CPD-22597|, |FRAME: D-Digitoxose|, |FRAME: CPD-22572|, |FRAME: D-Olivose|, and |FRAME: D-Fucoses|).
/
/While the mechanism whereby cardiac glycosides cause a positive inotropic effect and electrophysiologic changes of the hurt is still not completely clear, the most widely accepted mechanism involves the ability of cardiac glycosides to inhibit the membrane bound Na+/K+-ATPase pump responsible for Na+/K+ exchange |CITS: [KAUTE08]|.

In eukaryotes, among other roles, it is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids through the inner mitochondrial membrane. The physiological role of carnitine in bacteria is still unknown |CITS: [9037756]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Vitamin-A
TYPES - Vitamins
COMMON-NAME - vitamin A
SYNONYMS - tocopherol
COMMENT - Vitamin A is a group of related compounds that include |FRAME: Retinols retinol|, |FRAME: Retinals retinal|, |FRAME: Retinoates retinoate|, and several provitamin A carotenoids, among which |FRAME: CPD1F-129| is the most important.
/
/Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and for vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein |FRAME: Opsins opsin| to form the light-absorbing molecule rhodopsin (see |FRAME: PWY-6861|).
/
/Vitamin A, in the form of retinoic acid, is also an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.
/
/In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A are |FRAME: Retinyl-Esters esters|, primarily |FRAME: CHOCOLA_A|, which are converted to retinol in the small intestine.

UNIQUE-ID - B-vitamins
TYPES - Vitamins
COMMON-NAME - a B vitamin
COMMENT - B vitamins are a class of eight water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. The B vitamins were classified together because all of them serve as either enzyme cofactors, cosubstrates in important metabolic reactions, or as precursors for cofactors or cosubstrates. 
/
/The different B vitamins are chemically distinct compounds that do not resemble one another. The dietary supplements known as "B complexes" contain all eight of these compounds.
/
/The eight members of the vitamin B class are:
/
/Vitamin B<sub>1</sub>: |FRAME: THIAMINE|
/
/Vitamin B<sub>2</sub>: |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|
/
/Vitamin B<sub>3</sub>:|FRAME: NIACINE|, |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE|, and |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE "nicotinamide riboside"|

COMMENT - While folic acid is the name given to a particular compound (see |FRAME: CPD-12826|), it is also the name given to a group of compounds based on the |FRAME: PTEROATE| skeleton and conjugated with one or more molecules of |FRAME: GLT|. Many of these compounds are also known as vitamin B9.
/
/Folic acid on its own is not biologically active, and needs to be converted to tetrahydrofolate and other active derivatives (via dihydrofolate). The biologically active forms are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. 
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743][12644692]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

SYNONYMS - a tocochromenol
COMMENT - The term |FRAME: Vitamin-E| (tocochromenols) is a collective term for the eight forms of |FRAME: Tocotrienols tocotrienols| and |FRAME: Tocopherols tocopherols|, each existing as &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species.
/
/Structurally tocotrienols and tocopherols differ only in the degree of unsaturation of their side-chain. The tocotrienol chain comprises three <i>trans</i>-double bonds, whereas the tocopherol chain is fully saturated. In addition, the &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species of both compound groups vary in the methylation pattern of the chromanol ring |CITS:[12897790]|.
/
/Vitamin E compounds are synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms, although they are essential dietary components for animals (including humans), where they act primarily as antioxidants. Their presumed role in plants involve protection of chloroplast lipids and chlorophylls against oxidative damages. The tocotrienols are mostly found in monocots |CITS:[Padley94]| and a few dicots |CITS:[17110122]|, whereas tocopherols are wider spread in the plant kingdom and dominate in the dicots |CITS:[8827691]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Methyl-Acceptors "A methyl group donor"| is a compound that can donate a methyl group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.1.1 methyltransferase group"|.
/Prior to donating the methyl group the compound is |FRAME: Methylated-methyl-acceptors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Demethylated-methyl-acceptors|.
/
/Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction.

/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.

COMMON-NAME - a ginsenoside
SYNONYMS - a panaxoside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ginsenosides Ginsenosides| or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins found exclusively in the plant genus |FRAME: TAX-4053| (ginseng). They are the principal components responsible for the pharmaceutical activities of ginseng.
/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.
/
/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the
/minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| is a vitamin B12-dependent zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| to homocysteine.
/
/Methionine synthase is one of two eukaryotic enzymes that require a cobalamin prosthetic group for activity. Unlike the other enzyme (|FRAME: EC-5.4.99.2|), which requires adenosylcobalamin, the cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase needs to be methylated. Upon the initial transfer of a cob(II)alamin cofactor from a |FRAME: CPD-20918|, it is methylated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|, which uses |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as the methyl donor. The methyl group is subsequently transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, leaving the cofactor briefly in a cob(I)alamin form, which is regenerated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by a transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "5-methyltetrahydrofolate"| |CITS: [2407589]|.
/
/The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalysed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.2|).

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/The term "|FRAME: HEME_D|" has been used to describe the heme group found in two types of proteins: terminal oxidases such as the |FRAME: CYT-D-UBIOX-CPLX| and |FRAME: APP-UBIOX-CPLX| that predominate in |FRAME: TAX-562| at low levels of oxygen |CITS: [6307994]|, and a family of catalase enzymes, such as |FRAME: HYDROPEROXIDII-CPLX| from |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [Chiu89][18498226]|.
/
/Initial spectroscopy data on these enzymes suggested the presence of a &gamma;-spirolactone at the saturated pyrrole ring III of the macrocycle in the C-6 position and a vicinal C-5 hydroxy group |CITS: [Sotiriu88]|, although the relative orientation of these two groups was shown to be different in the two proteins (the two substituents have the more stable <i>trans</i> configuration in the terminal oxidases, but a <i>cis</i> configuration in HPII |CITS: [Chiu89]|). The absolute stereochemistry of the two chiral centers has not been reported |CITS: [8621527]|. However, later data indicated that the actual form of |FRAME: HEME_D| is a diol, and that lactonization was an artefact |CITS: [3777943]|.
/
/The enzymes responsible for the conversion of |FRAME: PROTOHEME| into |FRAME: HEME_D| have never been identified. It has been proposed that the formation of |FRAME: CPD-23429| may be catalyzed by HPII itself |CITS: [Timkovich90][9185614][22820098]|, though formation of |FRAME: CPD-23430| has not been explained.

TYPES - Organometallics
COMMON-NAME - a bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>
COMMENT - Green sulfur bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-191412|) and green flimentous bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-1106|) contain chlorosomes - large organelles that are believed to be the most efficient light-harvesting antennae in nature |CITS: [20130996][Saga10]|. Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.
/
/Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 1030 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.
/
/The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C-3<sup>1</sup> position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C-13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-13<sup>2</sup>-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.
/
/Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.
/
/In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-8<sup>2</sup> and C-12<sup>1</sup> carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-8<sup>2</sup> position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions. 
/
/Most of the green sulfur bacteria growing in stratified lakes contain |FRAME:CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"|. |FRAME:CPD-9094 "Bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| has been isolated from the chlorosomes of several strains of brown-colored |FRAME: TAX-191412|, including |FRAME: TAX-34090| and |FRAME: TAX-1096| |CITS: [12029393]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Chlorophylls Chlorophyll| is a green photosynthetic pigment found in photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria. Its name is derived from ancient Greek: <i>chloros</i> = green and <i>phyllon</i> = leaf.
/Chlorophyll functions as the main light harvesting pigment in photosynthesis, capturing photons and transfering them to the reaction centers. Chlorophyll absorbs mostly in the blue and, to a lesser extent, red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence its intense green color. There are several variants of chlorophyll (|FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|, |FRAME: CPD-10334|, |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B|, |FRAME: CPD-18895|, |FRAME: CPD-10336|, |FRAME: CPD-10337|, |FRAME: CPD-10335|, |FRAME: CPD-18896|, |FRAME: CPD-18897| and |FRAME: CPD-18898|).

COMMENT - Green sulfur bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-191412|) and green flimentous bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-1106|) contain chlorosomes - large organelles that are believed to be the most efficient light-harvesting antennae in nature |CITS: [20130996][Saga10]|. Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.
/
/Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 1030 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.
/
/The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C3<sup>1</sup> position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-13<sup>2</sup>-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.
/
/Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.
/
/In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-8<sup>2</sup> and C-12<sup>1</sup> carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-8<sup>2</sup> position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions. 
/
/Most of the green sulfur bacteria growing in stratified lakes contain |FRAME:CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"|, and species containing |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"| are rarely found |CITS: [vanGemerden95]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Bacteriochlorophyll-a
TYPES - Bacteriochlorins
TYPES - Organometallics
COMMON-NAME - a bacteriochlorophyll <i>a</i>
COMMENT - Bacteriochlorophylls are photosynthetic light harvesting pigments found in photosynthetic bacteria. There are many different types of bacteriochlorophylls, including |FRAME: Bacteriochlorophyll-a bacteriochlorophyll <i>a</i>|, |FRAME:CPD-9091|, |FRAME:CPD-9092|, |FRAME:CPD-9093|, |FRAME:CPD-9094| and |FRAME:CPD-9095| |CITS: [9442890]|, with vaying structures |CITS: [Senge95]|. In addition, while most of the bacteriochlorophylls contain a |FRAME: MG+2| ion, there are varieties that contain a |FRAME: ZN+2| ion |CITS: [Wakao96]|.
/
/Most of the bacteria that synthesize bacteriochlorophyll are anoxygenic species that belong to the proteobacteria. They are also known as purple bacteria, due to the color of the pigment. These species photosynthesize only under anaerobic conditions. However, bacteriochlorophylls are also present in some groups of aerobic bacteria, such as members of the Acidiphilium genus |CITS: [Wakao93]|. For a complete list of aerobic bacteria that contain bacteriochlorophyll, see |CITS: [12483616]|. Much of the knowledge about bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis comes from the organisms |FRAME: TAX-1061| and |FRAME: TAX-1063|, which produce mainly |FRAME:CPD-9067|, the most common form of the bacteriochlorophylls.
/
/|FRAME: Bacteriochlorophyll-a "Bacteriochlorophyll <i>a</i>"| is the most common type of bacteriochlorophyll, and is found in light-harvesting antenna systems and reaction center complexes of most anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, except for some purple bacteria that produce giving |FRAME:CPD-9091| and heliobacteria that produce |FRAME:CPD-9095|.
/
/Different forms of bacteriochloropyll <i>a</i> have been reported. The green sulfur bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1097| synthesizes
/two types - one with an esterified |FRAME: PHYTOL| side chain (|FRAME: CPD-9067|) and one with a |FRAME: CPD-18893| side chain (|FRAME: CPD-18892|). Some |FRAME: TAX-1218| spp. produce |FRAME: CPD-18894| |CITS: [10066832]|.

/
/PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/

UNIQUE-ID - Lignins
TYPES - Aromatic-Polymers
COMMON-NAME - a lignin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Lignins Lignin| is a complex phenolic biopolymer and an integral part of the secondary cell walls of plants and some algae. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, exceeded only by |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, and constitutes from a quarter to a third of the dry mass of wood.
/
/During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.
/
/Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
/The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strength.
/
/Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: RXN-17136 "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Phytoestrogens
TYPES - Estrogens
COMMON-NAME - a phytoestrogen
SYNONYMS - dietary estrogen
COMMENT - Estrogens are hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics in mammals by binding to estrogen receptors. They are important in both the menstrual and the estrous reproductive cycles.
/
/Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects, suggesting that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. The estrogens that occur naturally in the body are steroids, however other types of molecules acquired in the diet are known to bind to the estrogen receptors and are thus also considered estrogens. They include molecules produced by plants (phytoestrogens), molecules produced by fungi (mycoestrogens), and synthetic compounds (xenoestrogens).
/
/Phytoestrogens are a diverse group of naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity with |FRAME: CPD-352|, have the ability to cause estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic effects.
/
/Most phytoestrogens are mainly substituted natural phenolic compounds such as |FRAME: coumestans coumestans|, |FRAME: PRENYLFLAVANONES prenylflavonoids|, and |FRAME: Isoflavones isoflavones|. The best-researched are |FRAME: Isoflavones isoflavones|, which are commonly found in soy and red clover.

TYPES - Etf
TYPES - Reduced-Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein
SYNONYMS - ETFH<sub>2</sub>
SYNONYMS - a reduced ETF
SYNONYMS - a reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein
COMMENT - The electron transferring-flavoproteins (ETF) serve as specific electron carriers for other dehydrogenases.
/
/Most of the characterized electron-transferring flavoproteins belong to a single group (the canonical ETFs). These proteins, including those from mammals |CITS: [8962055]|, plants |CITS: [16923016]|, and some bacteria, such as the methylotrophic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-2327| |CITS: [7798207]| and the soil bacterium |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [10026281]|, are heterodimeric, contain one non-covalently bound FAD and one AMP per molecule, and function as electron carriers between diverse flavoproteins (such as |FRAME: ACYLCOADEHYDROG-MONOMER "acyl-CoA dehydrogenases"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6421|, and |FRAME: CPLX-7462|) and the quinone pool. They transfer the electrons to the main respiratory chain via |FRAME: EC-1.5.5.1| (ETF dehydrogenase).
/
/A different type of ETF possess electron transfer bifurcating activity: ability to accept a pair of electrons from NADH and use one to generate a strong reductant such as flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin. This endergonic electron transfer is paid for by exergonic transfer of the other electron to a strong electron acceptor via a corresponding partner enzyme, such as a quinone reductase in the case of ETFs associated with nitrogen fixation, or |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) in the case of some butanoate-producing anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [14688238]|.
/
/The bifurcating ETFs are also heterodimeric, but contain two FAD molecules (the presence of AMP has not been reported). The hydride group from NADH is transferred to the first FAD (the so-called bifurcating FAD or Bf-FAD), which passes one electron exergonically to the second FAD. By passing only a single electron the Bf-FAD assumes a reactive semiquinone state able to reduce ferredoxin or flavodoxin semiquinone. The second FAD (the electron transfer FAD, or ET-FAD), which correspond to the single FAD present in canonical ETFs, passes the electron it received to the second acceptor via exergonic electron transfer |CITS: [31588324]|. The two-flavin ETFs form a complex with the enzymes they interact with.

/Bacitracin disrupts cell wall and peptidoglycan synthesis by binding as a complex with metallic ions to |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE|, thus preventing its dephosphorylation into |FRAME: CPD-9646| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.27|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-9646| is a lipid carrier that is essential for the synthesis of many cell wall polymers including peptidoglycan. By sequestrating |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE| and preventing its dephosphorylation back into |FRAME: CPD-9646|, bacitracin prevents the loading of peptidoglycan precursors on the lipid carrier. Because translocation of these precursors to the external side of the membrane is drastically or totally impaired, further biosynthesis of the constituents of the cell envelope is stopped, eventually resulting in cell death.

COMMENT - Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds usually produced and secreted by microorganisms. Once outside the cell, siderophores bind |FRAME: FE+3| with high affinity, and the iron-siderophore complexes are imported back into the cell by active-transport mechanisms.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. 
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.

/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.

/Prior to donating the amino group the compound is |FRAME: Aminated-Amine-Donors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Deaminated-Amine-Donors|.
/
/Since tranmination reactions are reversible, the distinction between an amino group donor and an amino group acceptor is not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds, such as |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, are often used as amino group donors by the aminotransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Phthiocerols Phthiocerol|-based lipids and glycolipids have been found in many species of |FRAME: TAX-1762|, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-33894|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1777|, |FRAME: TAX-1769| and |FRAME: TAX-1809| |CITS: [3149973]|.
/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/Many organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-1769|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, and |FRAME: TAX-78331|, produce the related compound |FRAME: Phenolphthiocerols phenolphthiocerol|, which contains a phenol group at the &omega; end of the molecule |CITS: [3113946]|.
/
/The phenol is usually glycosylated by a type or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-78331| the trisaccharide (2,3,4-tri-<i>O</i>-methyl L-fucopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-rhamnopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-2-<i>O</i>-methyl L-rhamnopyranose) is attached.
/
/In addition, the two secondary alcohol functions are often esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| or |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| (see |FRAME: CPD-18579|) |CITS: [3113946]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Flavodoxins-Semiquinones
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a flavodoxin semiquinone
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-flavodoxins
TYPES - Flavodoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavodoxin
SYNONYMS - a dihydroflavidoxin
COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that serves a role similar to ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12| |CITS: [11687213]|
/
/Unlike ferredoxin, flavodoxins contain a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"| (FMN) cofactor. They exist in three redox states: in an |FRAME: Oxidized-flavodoxins "oxidized form"|, as a |FRAME: Flavodoxins-Semiquinones semiquinone|, or as the fully-reduced |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins hydroquinone|. The complexion of the cofactor FMN involves two distinct mechanisms in flavodoxins. The phosphoribityl part of the molecule is bound by hydrogen bonds, while the isoalloxazine ring is kept in place mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The phosphate group is bound by a loop that contains the key fingerprint motif for flavodoxins, T/S-X-T-G-X-T |CITS: [10610791]|. 
/
/Flavodoxins can be divided into two structural classes: short-chain flavodoxins with ~150 residues and long-chain flavodoxins with an insertion of ~20 amino-acid residues interrupting the final strand of &beta;-sheet.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. In many organisms, including cyanobacteria and anaerobes, Fld can substitute for Fd under conditions of iron deprivation.
/
/Please note that due to the limited ability to show protein structures, the structure shown here depicts only the FMN cofactor of flavodoxin.

UNIQUE-ID - Salmochelins
TYPES - Catecholate-siderophores
TYPES - Hydroxamate-siderophores
COMMON-NAME - a salmochelin
COMMENT - Salmochelins are C-glucosylated siderophores related to enterobactin that are produced by Salmonella species, uropathogenic and avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, and certain Klebsiella strains. Mono-, di-, and triglucosylated forms have been reported |CITS: [12655053][15259369][15598734]|.
/
/The glucosylation has been interpreted as a bacterial evasion mechanism against the mammalian catecholate siderophore-binding protein siderocalin.

//
UNIQUE-ID - CPD-18345
TYPES - Hydroxamate-siderophores
COMMON-NAME - a mycobactin
COMMENT - The important pathogen |FRAME: TAX-1773| relies on 2-hydroxyphenyloxazoline-containing siderophore molecules called mycobactins for the acquisition of iron in the restrictive environment of the mammalian macrophage.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Pyoverdines
TYPES - Catecholate-siderophores
TYPES - Hydroxamate-siderophores
COMMON-NAME - a pyoverdine
COMMENT - Pyoverdines are a group of structurally related siderophores produced by fluorescent Pseudomonas species, in which they provide the primary iron uptake system.
/
/Even though the structures of more than 50 different pyoverdines from different strains and species of Pseudomonas have been determined, they all possess a similar structure composed of three parts: a conserved fluorescent dihydroxyquinoline chromophore, an acyl side chain (either dicarboxylic acid or amide) bound to the amino group of the chromophore (R1 in the structure below), and a variable peptide chain linked by an amide group bound to the C1 (rarely C3) carboxyl group of the chromophore (R2 in the structure below) |CITS: [17118662]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Catecholate-siderophores
TYPES - Catechols
TYPES - Siderophore
COMMON-NAME - a catecholate siderophore
COMMENT - Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds usually produced and secreted by microorganisms. Once outside the cell, siderophores bind |FRAME: FE+3| with high affinity, and the iron-siderophore complexes are imported back into the cell by active-transport mechanisms.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. 
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.
/
/Catecholate siderophores are named based on a |FRAME: CATECHOL| element present in their structure (catecholate is the name of the anion form that is the conjugate base of catechol).

UNIQUE-ID - All-tRNAs
TYPES - ssRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA
SYNONYMS - a transfer RNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/This class encompasses both charged and uncharged tRNA molecules.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/In most organisms the two hydroxyl groups are esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"|. In |FRAME: TAX-1781| and |FRAME: TAX-1809|, however, they are esterified by |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| |CITS: [3149973][3113946]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Sphingomyelins

COMMON-NAME - a sphingomyelin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

COMMON-NAME - a glycosphingolipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids Glycosphingolipids| are a family of complex lipids composed of |FRAME: Ceramides| and mono- or oligosaccharide moieties that play an important role in various cellular functions including recognition, cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation |CITS: [8490246]|. The lipid portion is embedded in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and the sugar chains extended to the outer environment, acting as an antigen. Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.
/
/Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.
/
/Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.
/
/|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Jasmonates
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a jasmonate or derivative
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.
/
/This master class includes a large set of cyclopentanone derivatives of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonate"|. Confusingly, these compounds are often referred to collectively by the name "jasmonates".

TYPES - Cardiac-Glycosides
COMMON-NAME - a cardenolide glycoside
COMMENT - Cardiac glycosides are plant-made compounds (mostly by members of the |FRAME: TAX-4163| genus, or Foxgloves) that have beneficial effects over patients with cardiac failure. The treatment of congestive heart failure (dropsy), among other ailments like tuberculosis, by the use of Foxglove is mentioned in writings as early as 1250 A. D., when the Welsh Physicians of Myddva collected foxglove as one of their many herbs and included it in their remedies. |CITS: [28561136]|.
/
/The cardiac glycosides are composed of two structural features: a sugar moiety that may contain one or more saccharides, and a steroid aglycone. Cardiac glycosides having a terminal glucose are called primary glycosides whereas those lacking such a sugar are termed secondary glycosides.
/
/There are two classes of cardiac glycosides differing by the group attached at the 17-position of the aglycone: the |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolides"|, which have a five-membered unsaturated lactone ring (but-2-en-4-olide ring) and the |FRAME: Bufadienolide-Glycosides bufadienolides|, which have a six membered doubly unsaturated lactone ring (penta-2,4-dien-5-olide ring).
/
/The steroid nucleus of the cardiac glycosides have a unique configuration: rings A/B and C/D are <i>cis</i>- fused while rings B/C are <i>trans</i>- fused. The nucleus has &beta; configured hydroxyls at the positions C-3 and C-14, and many compounds have additional hydroxyl groups at positions 12 and 16. The sugars found in the glycoside moiety range from common hexoses and pentoses (such as |FRAME: D-Glucose|, |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE|, and |FRAME: D-Xylose|) to very uncommon sugars, some of which have only been found in cardiac glycosides (e.g. |FRAME: D-quinovopyranose|, |FRAME: CPD-22597|, |FRAME: D-Digitoxose|, |FRAME: CPD-22572|, |FRAME: D-Olivose|, and |FRAME: D-Fucoses|).
/
/While the mechanism whereby cardiac glycosides cause a positive inotropic effect and electrophysiologic changes of the hurt is still not completely clear, the most widely accepted mechanism involves the ability of cardiac glycosides to inhibit the membrane bound Na+/K+-ATPase pump responsible for Na+/K+ exchange |CITS: [KAUTE08]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Steroidal-Estrogens
TYPES - Estrogens
TYPES - Steroid-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a steroidal estrogen
COMMENT - Estrogens are hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics in mammals by binding to estrogen receptors. They are important in both the menstrual and the estrous reproductive cycles.
/
/Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects, suggesting that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. The estrogens that occur naturally in the body are steroids, however other types of molecules acquired in the diet are known to bind to the estrogen receptors and are thus also considered estrogens. They include molecules produced by plants (phytoestrogens), molecules produced by fungi (mycoestrogens), and synthetic compounds (xenoestrogens).
/
/The main steroidal |FRAME: Estrogens estrogens| in humans are |FRAME: ESTRONE|, |FRAME: CPD-352| and |FRAME: ESTRIOL|, which differ in the number of hydroxyl groups (one for |FRAME: ESTRONE|, two for |FRAME: CPD-352| and three for |FRAME: ESTRIOL|). |FRAME: CPD-352| is about 10 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRONE| and about 80 times as potent as |FRAME: ESTRIOL| in its estrogenic effect.

COMMENT - 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) is a prosthetic group of several enzymes |CITS: [12686130]| that is formed by autocatalytic post-translational modifications of three amino acids within the protein (generally A-S-G but T-S-G has also been reported) |CITS: [10220322][22319000]|.
/
/The MIO group is an electrophile, and reacts with an amino group of the substrate (&alpha;-phenylalanine, &alpha;-tyrosine, or &alpha;-histidine, depending on the enzyme). This interaction facilitates the stereoselective abstraction of one of the C&beta; protons by a nearby tyrosine base located in the lid loop that covers the active site of the enzyme |CITS: [11732994][17185228][17516659][18346767]|. The abstraction of the proton is accompanied, sequentially or simultaneously, by the cleavage of the N-C&alpha; bond and leads to the formation of a product with an unsaturated C&alpha;-C&beta; bond.
/
/The last step depends on the nature of the enzyme. in lyases, the unsaturated product and the amino
/group (as ammonia) are released into the environment |CITS: [5354960]|. In aminomutases the amine group (as a MIO-amine adduct) and the unsaturated product are retained in the active site and the unsaturated product is reaminated and reprotonated at the other C atom |CITS: [15494399 ][18078753][21561099]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Mycofactocins Mycofactocins| (MFT) are a family of related electron acceptors that are used by dehydrogenases that belong to the TIGR03971, TIGR03989, and TIGR04266 families.
/
/The identity of the cofactor has not been known until 2019, and enzymes that require it were initially analyzed using artificial electron acceptors. The first clue to mycofactocin's identity came in 2011 when bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the co-occurrence of the genes <i>mftABCDEF</i> in over 600 bacterial species, including pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1764|, and |FRAME: TAX-1809|, with genes encoding the dehydrogenases of the above mentioned families |CITS: [21223593]|. Further studies have shown that mycofactocins originate from a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (MftA). The C terminus of the peptide, consisting of |FRAME: VAL|-|FRAME: TYR|, is oxidatively decarboxylated and cyclized by a radical SAM enzyme and cleaved, followed by oxidative deamination to generate the |FRAME: CPD-22872| aglycone, which contains the redox center of MFT.

UNIQUE-ID - Flavin-Electorin-Carriers
TYPES - Redox-Electron-Carriers
COMMON-NAME - a flavin electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinone
SYNONYMS - a vitamin K2
COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

COMMENT - Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, sex expression, enzyme induction, and leaf and fruit senescence.
/
/All known gibberellins are diterpenoid acids that are synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol until they reach their biologically-active form (see |FRAME: PWY-5052|). The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery.
/
/All gibberellins have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME: CPD1F-95| and |FRAME: CPD1F-134|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-95|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-134|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.

/
/Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [10687384]|.
/
/Most bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.

SYNONYMS - THF polyglutamate
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - TR-12
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Transport Energized by the Membrane Electrochemical Gradient
COMMENT - Transport reactions in this class are catalysed by proteins which use the energy of the membrane electrochemical gradient to drive uptake or export of substrates. These membrane proteins can catalyze uniport (a single species is transported), antiport (two species are transported in opposite directions) or symport (two species are transported together in the same direction). Symporters and antiporters are secondary active transporters which use chemiosmotic energy in the form  of a proton, sodium or other solute gradient to drive transport of one substrate against it's concentration gradient. Membrane uniporters in this class catalyse the transport of a substrate down its concentration gradient in a membrane potential dependent process.<BR>Proteins catalysing these reactions are members of IUBMB Transport Classification Family 2

/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.

/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties.

UNIQUE-ID - Strigolactones
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a strigolactone
COMMENT - Strigolactones are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659| from |FRAME: TAX-4558| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660| from |FRAME: TAX-3917| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657| from |FRAME: TAX-57577| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.
/
/Study of mutants lacking strigolactones suggest that the hormones are also involved in the regulation of shoot branching, acting as branch-inhibiting hormones |CITS: [15268852][15342640]|.

/Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/Lipopolysaccharides that comprise all three regions are called |FRAME: Smooth-Form-LPS "smooth (S)-form LPS"|, while LPS lacking the <i>O</i>-antigen are named |FRAME: LOS "rough (R)-form LPS"| or lipooligosaccharide (LOS).
/
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negative bacteria, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the <i>O</i>-antigen's side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.
/
/The <i>O</i>-antigen usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.

/|FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: EC-2.7.12.2| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes.

TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC]-<i>S</i>-sulfanyl-L-cysteine
SYNONYMS - a DsrC persulfide
SYNONYMS - a [DsrC protein] persulfide
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In the sulfur-oxidizing bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol is oxidized to form a trisulfide bridge with CysB. This trisulfide bridge then serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes an oxidation reaction. The oxidized middle sulfur is released in the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with two reduced cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485][20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducers DsrAB catalyzes the opposite reaction, adding the sulfur atom of sulfite to DsrC and forming the trisulfide bridge with the two cysteine residues. This third sulfur atom is then released in the form of hydrogen sulfide in a reaction catalyzed by DsrK, restoring DsrC to its reduced form |CITS: [26680199]|.
/
/In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.

COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. A second cyteine residue (CysB), located 11 residues before CysA, is also involved in DsrC's activity.
/
/In the sulfur-oxidizing bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol is oxidized to form a trisulfide bridge with CysB. This trisulfide bridge then serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes an oxidation reaction. The oxidized middle sulfur is released in the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with two reduced cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485][20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducers DsrAB catalyzes the opposite reaction, adding the sulfur atom of sulfite to DsrC and forming the trisulfide bridge with the two cysteine residues. This third sulfur atom is then released in the form of hydrogen sulfide in a reaction catalyzed by DsrK, restoring DsrC to its reduced form |CITS: [26680199]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Inositols
TYPES - Cyclitols
COMMON-NAME - an inositol
SYNONYMS - 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol
COMMENT - |FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

UNIQUE-ID - Aminomalonyl-ClbG
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - [ClbG aminomalonyltransferase]-aminomalonyl-L-serine
COMMENT - The <i>clbG</i>, which is located in the colibactin biosynthesis cluster, encodes a protein with a single acyltransferase (AT) domain. The protein receives an aminomalonyl residue from its carrier protein ClbE and transfers it to the thiolation domains of the ClbK and ClbO pplyketide synthases |CITS: [26890481][31395743]|.
/
/AT domains recognize a particular thioesterified extender unit with high specificity and transacylate it onto a downstream acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. The reaction proceeds via a ping-pong mechanism. The first half of the reaction consists of the AT receiving the extender unit from the carrier portion of the substrate, resulting in the esterification of the moiety on the side chain of the active site serine residue. In the second half of the reaction, the extender unit is transferred from the active site serine residue of the AT onto the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl arm of the downstream ACP. This
/second step requires the AT to make protein-protein interactions with their partner downstream ACP domains |CITS: [11548049]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine.
/
/Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Cullins Cullins| are a family of proteins that provide a scaffold for some RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferases (|FRAME: EC-2.3.2.27 "EC 2.3.2.27"|), which are not able to bind a substrate protein directly. These E3 proteins form a complex with a cullin protein and a substrate recognition subunit (SRS). Some complexes also include an adaptor that links the SRS to the complex. The complexes are known as CRLs for Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligases.
/
/CRLs comprise the largest known category of ubiquitin ligases, and regulate an extensive number of dynamic cellular processes, including multiple aspects of the cell cycle, transcription, signal transduction, and development |CITS: [18282298]|. 
/
/There are five major types of cullins in metazoa, each of which forms a distinct class of CRL complex, with distinct adaptors and/or substrate-recognition subunits. CRLs are activated by the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein |FRAME: NEDD8 NEDD8| to the cullin, and are inhibited by binding to the CAND1 inhibitor |CITS: [15688063]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/
/In plant and mammalian type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that are present in motifs with the pattern -C-X<sub>4,5</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>-C-, with n=&tilde;30.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions. Ferredoxins characteristically transfer an electron
/with a reduction potential E0' near -420mV (though the reduction potential of ferredoxins from some anaerobic microorganisms can be as low as -500mV |CITS: [Li16]| and as high as -340mV |CITS: [12610725]|).
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.

/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

COMMENT - In eukaryotes, |FRAME: N-terminal-asparagine "N-terminal Asn"| (N) and |FRAME: L-Glutaminyl-Peptides "N-terminal Gln"| (Q) are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they function, through enzymatic deamidation, to yield the secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp (D) and Glu (E). Asp and Glu are conjugaed by ATE1-encoded Arg-tRNA-protein transferase, to arginine, one of the primary destabilizing N-terminal residues. Arginine is recognized by the E3 Ub ligases of the N-end rule pathway, called N-recognins.

COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC protein]-dithiol
SYNONYMS - a [DsrC protein]-L-cysteine
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.
/
/In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Phthiocerols Phthiocerol|-based lipids and glycolipids have been found in many species of |FRAME: TAX-1762|, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-33894|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1777|, |FRAME: TAX-1769| and |FRAME: TAX-1809| |CITS: [3149973]|.
/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached. Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10.
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/Many organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-1769|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, and |FRAME: TAX-78331|, produce the related compound |FRAME: Phenolphthiocerols phenolphthiocerol|, which contains a phenol group at the &omega; end of the molecule |CITS: [3113946]|.
/
/The phenol is usually glycosylated by a type or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-78331| the trisaccharide (2,3,4-tri-<i>O</i>-methyl L-fucopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-rhamnopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-2-<i>O</i>-methyl L-rhamnopyranose) is attached.
/
/In addition, the two secondary alcohol functions are often esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| or |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| (see |FRAME: CPD-18579|) |CITS: [3113946]|.

UNIQUE-ID - DsrC-disulfide-form
TYPES - Protein-Disulfides
COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC protein] with an intramolecular disulfide bond
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.
/
/In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Kanamycins Kanamycins| are a group of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1967|. The compounds were discovered in 1957 by researchers in the National Institute of Health of Tokyo, Japan |CITS: [13513509][13595489]|. Due to their wide range of activity, especially against severe staphylococcal and mycobacterial infections, these antibiotics gained almost immediate acceptance, and the most common form, |FRAME: CPD-4821|, was produced commercially within a year of its discovery |CITS: [13566481]|.
/
/Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|. Kanamycins are currently used to treat a wide variety of infections.
/
/Kanamycins share several biosynthetic intermediates with other aminoglycosides, including the core moiety |FRAME: CPD-10151| and the pseudodisaccharides |FRAME: CPD-14126|, |FRAME: CPD-14125| and |FRAME: CPD-14137|.
/
/While the main product produced by |FRAME: TAX-1967| is |FRAME: CPD-4821| (R1 = NH2; R2 = OH), additional products are also produced, including |FRAME: CPD-4822| (R1 = R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>), |FRAME: CPD-4823| (R1 = OH; R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>) |CITS: [13563334][13587408]|, |FRAME: CPD-14138| (similar to |FRAME: CPD-4821|, but contains a glucose moiety instead of the kinosamine moiety) |CITS: [Adams96]| and |FRAME: CPD-4824| (R1 = R2 = OH) |CITS: [Chang80]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Butirosins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a butirosin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-14140 "Butirosins A"| and |FRAME: CPD-14193| are naturally occurring derivatives of the |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "2-aminoglycoside antibiotics"| |FRAME: CPD-14196| and |FRAME: CPD-14143|, respectively, produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1397| and discovered in the early 1970s |CITS: [4207954][4670491][4670492]|.
/
/The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
/
/Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

COMMON-NAME - a lividomycin
COMMENT - The lividomycins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycosidic antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-282216|. The lividomycins were discovered In Japan in the early 70s |CITS: [5091208][5092785][5092786][ 4624613][4647833]|. Like other aminoglucoside antibiotics, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA |CITS: [4945812][4586150]|. 
/
/Despite promising initial results against urinary tract infections |CITS: [4579561][4579564][4203572]|, tuberculosis |CITS:[4721804][4142798]| and other respiratory tract infections |CITS: [807755][1041282]|, lividomycin never became widely used.

/
/Gentamicins are particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, and are bactericidal. They act by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis. Despite their high antibacterial activity, intravenous use is limited by their ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, they are used commonly as a topical treatment to skin infections. The most common form of gentamycin is the C complex, which consists of a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-14213|, |FRAME: CPD-14216|, |FRAME: CPD-14211| and |FRAME: CPD-14212|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Neomycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a neomycin
COMMENT - Neomycins are a family of broad-spectrum highly toxic antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1906|. They were discovered in 1949 by Waksman and Lechevalier (Waksman later received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine) |CITS: [17782716]|.
/
/Neomycin usually exists as a complex composed of two stereoisomers, |FRAME: CPD-14142| and |FRAME: CPD-14141|, which are the two active components. A third component, |FRAME: CPD-14137 "neomycin A"|, which is a degradation product, is present in small quantities.
/
/Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

UNIQUE-ID - tRNAs
TYPES - All-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.

UNIQUE-ID - carotenoids
TYPES - Tetraterpenes
COMMON-NAME - a carotenoid
COMMENT - |FRAME: carotenoids Carotenoids| are isoprenoid pigments in the yellow to red color range. They have conjugated double bond chains of varying length with varying substituents, which determines their light absorption spectrum. They are produced by photosynthetic organisms and some non-photosynthetic fungi and bacteria. Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.
/
/Carotenoids have diverse functions that include participation in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, serving as antioxidants, virulence factors, and modulation of membrane function. In photosynthetic organisms carotenoids provide protection against photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments as well as light-harvest. The prominent |FRAME: CPD1F-119|, as well as |FRAME: CPD1F-130|, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal. Carotenoids serve as precursors for the plant growth hormone |FRAME: Abscisic-Acid| and |FRAME: Vitamin-A| (for a succinct review of the applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|). In addition, they may be cleaved to |FRAME: Apocarotenoids apocarotenoids|, whose functions include serving as a cofactor for light-sensing proteins, acting as hormones, or acting as antifungals. Carotenoids have been the subject of metabolic pathway engineering studies because microbial carotenoid production is environmentally preferable to chemical synthesis.
/
/Over 700 carotenoids have been identified. The two main structural classes of carotenoids are the |FRAME: Carotenes carotenes| and the |FRAME: Xanthophylls xanthophylls|, which are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons, respectively. 
/Most carotenoids have a C40 chain length derived from the symmetric precursor |FRAME: CPD-12321| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6287|). |FRAME: CPD-12321| is derived from |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|, which is in turn derived from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| and |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5120|). 
/
/Larger, C50 carotenoids also occur in nature and appear to be derived from the addition of two isoprene units to a C40 carotenoid.  Although biosynthetic intermediates and novel bacterial genes involved in C50 carotenoid biosynthesis from |FRAME: CPD1F-114| have been identified and biosynthetic pathways postulated, details of all of the enzyme reactions involved in these pathways remain to be determined (as in |CITS: [20802040] [17008032] [11511870] [11432736]|).
/
/Smaller, C30 carotenoids have also been found in plants and microorganisms.  In microorganisms they appear to be synthesized by a distinct C30 pathway, whereas in plants they appear to result from cleavage of C40 carotenoids.  |FRAME: CPD-9911| is a bacterial C30 carotenoid derived from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP|.  It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite |FRAME: CPD-9916| in |FRAME: TAX-1280| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5875|).  |FRAME: CPD-9911| has also been identified in a few other bacteria |CITS: [20303609] [9297464]|.
/
/Genes encoding the enzymes of carotenoid biosynthesis have been cloned from many plants, cyanobacteria and other microorganisms (|CITS: [20582313][11511870][18535920] [17257797] [17912511][12730708]|. Extensive comparative genomics analysis of microbial carotenoid biosynthetic proteins has shown new phylogenetic and evolutionary patterns of these pigments that had not been found in previous, more limited, analyses |CITS: [20582313]|.

/In the major PGL of |FRAME: TAX-1769|, known as PGL-1, the phenolphthiocerol moiety is attached to the trisaccharide 3,6-di-<i>O</i>-methyl-&beta;-D-glucopyranosyl-(1&rarr;4)-2,3-di-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1&rarr;3)-3-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-L-rhamnopyranose and the two secondary alcohol functions are esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| |CITS: [3113946]|. PGL-1 inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A, seems to be associated with resistance to intracellular killing by macrophages, and promotes phagocytosis of |FRAME: TAX-1769| by macrophages and Schwann cells through binding to complement component C3 and laminin-2, respectively.

UNIQUE-ID - N-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine
TYPES - Sphingomyelins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i>-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine
COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

COMMON-NAME - a globo-series glycosphingolipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids Glycosphingolipids| are a family of complex lipids composed of |FRAME: Ceramides| and mono- or oligosaccharide moieties that play an important role in various cellular functions including recognition, cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation |CITS: [8490246]|. The lipid portion is embedded in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and the sugar chains extended to the outer environment, acting as an antigen.
/
/Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.
/
/Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.
/
/Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.
/
/|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide| is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.

COMMENT - Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid found in the cell membrane. It faces the cytosolic (inner) side of the cell membrane, and is held in place by the enzyme flippase. When a cell undergoes apoptosis, phospholipid scramblase catalyzes the rapid exchange of phosphatidylserine between the two sides. When PS flips to the extracellular (outer) surface, it acts as a signal for macrophages to engulf the cells |CITS: [7595231]|. Phosphatidylserine also plays an important role in blood coagulation |CITS: [12814644]|.
/
/In bacteria PS is biosynthesized by condensing |FRAME: SER| with |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.8|. In animalsPS is only produced by base-exchange reactions with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.29|.

UNIQUE-ID - Gangliosides
TYPES - Glycosphingolipids
COMMON-NAME - a ganglioside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Gangliosides "Gangliosides"| are molecules composed of |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids| (|FRAME: Ceramides| and |FRAME: Oligosaccharides|) with one or more sialic acids (usually |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE|) linked to the sugar chain. They are components of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appear to concentrate in lipid rafts.
/
/The name ganglioside is derived from the ganglion cells of the brain, from which the first gangliosides were isolated by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942 |CITS: [Klenk42]|. Indeed, gangliosides dominate the composition of the glycocalyces of most of the cells of the vertebrate nervous system. Although gangliosides with various glycan structures are found in every vertebrate tissue, they are markedly more abundant in the nervous system, where each cell has on average about 10 million cell surface gangliosides |CITS: [27261254]|.
/
/Variations in the sialoglycan and lipid components of the gangliosides result in hundreds of distinct ganglioside structures with a variety of functions that ranges from regulating receptor tyrosine kinases to directing cell-cell communication, cell-substrate interaction, adhesion, and protein targeting |CITS: [17991443]|. Mammalian brain gangliosides, however, are dominated by only four types of gangliosides - |FRAME: CPD-7188 "ganglioside GM1a|, |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINYL-ETCETERA-GLUCOSYLCERA "ganglioside GD1a"|, |FRAME: Ganglioside-GD1b "ganglioside GD1b"| and |FRAME: Ganglioside-GT1b "ganglioside GT1b"| |CITS: [22735313]|. The ceramide lipid components of brain gangliosides are dominated by a single fatty acid (|FRAME: STEARIC_ACID|) attached to one of two sphingoid bases, |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE| and |FRAME: CPD-19684| |CITS: [21113547]|.
/While many non-human mammals synthesize gangliosides that contain two types of sialic acids - |FRAME: N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE| and |FRAME: CPD-273|, mammalian brain gangliosides almost exclusively carry the former.
/
/Like other glycosphingolipids, gangliosides are biosynthesized stepwise by a series of glycosyltransferases that use nucleotide sugar donors to first glucosylate ceramide and then elongate the saccharide chain .|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.
/
/The ceramide lipid of glycosphingolipids is embedded in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane, with the glycan extending  2-2.5 nm outward, perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer |CITS: [19056784]|. What makes gangliosides different from other glycosphingolipids is the incorporation of sialic acids. With a mean Pka value of around 2.6, sialic acids are more acidic than the majority of carboxylic acids and negatively charged at most physiological pH values.
/
/<b>About the nomenclature of gangliosides</b>
/
/Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.
/
/A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.
/The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).
/
/In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides a-series|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides b-series|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a b and c in their names.
/
/So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

/Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.
/
/Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.
/
/Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.

TYPES - Jasmonates
COMMON-NAME - a jasmonate
SYNONYMS - a jasmonic acid
SYNONYMS - a JA
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 12-Hydroxyjasmonates "Tuberonic acid"| (12-hydroxyjasmonate) was first described from potato and Solanaceous species for its tuber-inducing activity, hence its trivial name |CITS:[Helder93]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H1
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced unknown one electron carrier
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown one electron donor
SYNONYMS - A(H)
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown one electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

UNIQUE-ID - Plastoquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinol
SYNONYMS - PQ
COMMENT - Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. Plastoquinone can function as acceptor/donor for one or two electrons. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/
/Please note that the structure shown here is that of |FRAME: CPD-12829| and is not accurate for this generic class of compounds, which contains plastoquinols with different side-chain lengths.

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - an ubiquinol
SYNONYMS - a reduced ubiquinone
SYNONYMS - a dihydroubiquinone
SYNONYMS - a QH<sub>2</sub>
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

UNIQUE-ID - Menaquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinol
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor chaperone]-cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor
COMMENT - Many enzymes depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The so called maturation of MoCo involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center, replacing an oxo group. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.9| (e.g. the plant ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|. However, prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone (such as XdhC) before it is sulfurylated by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.7|. Many of the prokaryotic molybdoenzymes have a specific chaperone |CITS: [23201473]|. The chaperones interact with the desulfurase, so that MoCo is sulfurated while it is still bound to the chaperone and before the insertion into the target protein. Binding to the chaperone stabilizes the sulfurated form of MoCo. Once sulfurylated, the chaperone transfer the cofactor to its target protein |CITS: [17649978]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

COMMON-NAME - a bile acid
COMMENT - Bile (or gall) is a dark green to yellowish brown fluid, produced by the liver of most vertebrates, that aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine. In humans bile is produced continuously by the liver and stored and concentrated in the gall bladder. After eating, the bile is discharged into the the first section of the small intestine (the duodenum).
/The main active ingredient (about 0.7%) of the bile is bile acids.
/
/Bile acids are classified into primary and secondary. The primary bile acids are produced in the liver from |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL|. About half of the cholesterol produced in the body is used for bile acid synthesis. Their structures vary, as do their proportions in different species. The primary bile acids are conjugated in the liver with |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: TAURINE| before secretion into the bile. Further conversion into secondary bile acids occurs through the action of microbial enzymes in the gut.

UNIQUE-ID - Adenine-Cytokinins
TYPES - Cytokinins
COMMON-NAME - an adenine-type cytokinin
COMMENT - Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.
/
/Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the <i>N</i>-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.
/
/The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Tricothecenes

The trichothecene family has been divided into four groups: Type A, B, C, and D. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12,13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus, and the structure and position of the side-chain. Type D trichothecenes, which have an additional ring between carbon 4 and carbon 15, are thought to be the most toxic |CITS: [22069741]|.
/
/The toxicity of tricothecenes primarily results from their interaction with ribosomes, acting as protein synthesis inhibitors |CITS: [Kiessling86]|. Various |FRAME: TAX-5506| species such as |FRAME: TAX-5518|, |FRAME: TAX-5514|, |FRAME: TAX-36050| and |FRAME: TAX-61235| produce tricothecenes on many different grains like wheat, oats or maize. An outbreak in Orenburg, Russia in 1932 affected ~100,000 people, with a mortality rate of 60%.
/
/Some producers, such as |FRAME: TAX-74722|, grow in damp indoor environments such as wallpaper, and produce trichothecenes that become airborne and contribute to health problems among occupants |CITS: [11798344][15640178][16269780]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Lipid-A
TYPES - Lipid-A-containing-Glycolipids
COMMON-NAME - a lipid A
COMMENT - Lipid A is a lipid component of the |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides "lipopolysaccharides"| (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. Its hydrophobic nature allows it to anchor the LPS to the outer membrane.
/
/Lipid A consists of two glucosamine units decorated with four to six acyl chains and one or two phosphate groups. Four &beta; hydroxy acyl chains, 10 to 18 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars at positions N-2 and O-3 (and N'-2 and O'-3, respectively), while two additional acyl chains are often attached to the &beta; hydroxy group of two of the four &beta; hydroxy acyl chains. The phosphate groups are attached at position O-1, O'-4, or both.
/
/Since the fully acylated lipid A is assembled only when attached to the core oligosaccharide, a "stand alone" lipid A, as depicted here, does not occur naturally.

UNIQUE-ID - Bryostatins
TYPES - Macrolides
COMMON-NAME - a bryostatin
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Bryostatins bryostatins| are a family of structurally related macrolide compounds originally found in the bryozoan |FRAME: TAX-10212|. The |FRAME: TAX-10205| are marine colonial filter-feeders, with each member (polypide) enclosed in a separate unit (zooecium).
/
/|FRAME: CPD-21475 "Bryostatin 1"|, the first member to have its structure reported, was identified from samples collected from the California coast. The authors noted its anticancer activity, which they described as "remarkable" |CITS: [Pettit82]|. Other samples, collected in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of California, and other locations, afforded other members. Currently 20 members of the bryostatin family are known |CITS: [Pettit91]|.
/
/In 1990 it was suggested that the bryostatins may be produced by endosymbiotic bacteria |CITS: [Anthoni90]|. The presence of such endosymbionts was confirmed in 1997, and based on small-subunit rRNA gene sequence the organisms were found to belong to a new genus within the &gamma;-proteobacteria. They were named |FRAME: TAX-62101| |CITS: [9361448]|. The bacteria cannot be cultivated outside the host; however, the discovery of genes encoding polyketide synthases in the bacterial DNA provided proof for a bacterial origin of the bryostatins |CITS: [11571152]|.
/
/Most, but not all, of the bryostatins pharmacological effects are attributed to their interaction with the |FRAME: Diacyl-sn-Glycerols diacylglycerol| binding site of the C-1, C-19 and C-26 regulatory domain of |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.13| |CITS: [20971628]|. In addition, bryostatins can function as very potent immunostimulants (in |CITS: [24033119]|). More than 30 clinical trials have been conducted with |FRAME: CPD-21475| in monotherapy or in combination with clinically used cytotoxic drugs, testing its efficacy against different tumor types such as sarcoma, melanoma, ovaria, cervical, neck and head carcinoma, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, renal cell carcinoma, as well as a variety of leukemias, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. However, phase II studies of |FRAME: CPD-21475| have failed to demonstrate any clinically meaningful activity, and bryostatin has not progressed to phase III clinical trials as a cancer treatment |CITS: [Newman12]|.
/
/On the other hand, |FRAME: CPD-21475| has been shown to reverse synaptic loss and facilitate synaptic maturation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Fragile X, stroke, and other neurological disorders. Advanced Alzheimer patients treated with bryostatin demonstrated return of major functions such as swallowing, vocalization, and word recognition, and currently Phase II clinical trials are conducted with |FRAME: CPD-21475| as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease |CITS: [28482641]|.

UNIQUE-ID - PENICILLIN
TYPES - Penams
COMMON-NAME - a penicillin
COMMENT - Penicillins are medically important |FRAME: Beta-Lactams "&beta;-lactam"| antibiotics biosynthesized as end products by certain filamentous fungi, including |FRAME: TAX-5076| and |FRAME: TAX-162425|.
/
/&Beta;-Lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by the irreversible binding of their four-membered &beta;-lactam ring to the so-called |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins "penicillin binding proteins"| (PBPs).
/The PBPs are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since the &beta;-lactam moiety of |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive.
/Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.
/This irrevesible binding prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the formation of these cross-links, resulting in a defective cell wall and cell death.
/
/Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as syphilis, and infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, although more and more types of bacteria have acquired resistance.

/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and heme <i>a</i> synthase.

UNIQUE-ID - HEME_C
TYPES - Hemes
COMMON-NAME - heme <i>c</i>
COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/The term "|FRAME: HEME_C|" has been used to describe the heme group attached to |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes"|. Heme <i>c</i> differs from |FRAME: Heme-b| in that the two vinyl side chains of the latter are replaced by covalent, thioether linkages to the apoprotein. The two thioether linkages are typically made by cysteine residues of the protein. The covalent bonds prevent |FRAME: HEME_C| from easily dissociating from the cytochrome <i>c</i> holoprotein, unlike the case of |FRAME: Heme-b|- and |FRAME: HEME_A|-containing cytochromes.
/
/Since the modifications that define the heme <i>c</i> molecule are generated by its attachment to the protein, it does not naturally occur in a free form. The sulfur atoms shown in this structure are not an integral part of the heme molecule, but rather show the location of the thioether bonds. This generic form does not specify the oxidation state of the iron.

//
UNIQUE-ID - QUINOLINE-ALKALOIDS
TYPES - ALKALOIDS-SYN
COMMON-NAME - Quinoline Alkaloid Biosynthesis
COMMENT - The biosynthetic origin of quinoline alkaloids is the aromatic amine anthranilic (2-aminobenzoic) acid involved in the metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. The skeleton of quinoline alkaloids constitutes a bicyclic system with a fused benzene and pyridine ring. The attachment of a furan ring to the pyridine nucleus generates furoquinolines (e.g. furacridone), an important subgroup of quinoline alkaloids. The plant family <i>Rutaceae</i> represents the major source of quinoline alkaloids, e.g. maculine. Quinoline alkaloide are known to possess pharmaceutical activites but only a few such as quinine are used in medicine because of their antimalarial properties.

UNIQUE-ID - Bacteriochlorophyllide-d
TYPES - Chlorophyllides
COMMON-NAME - a bacteriochlorophyllide <i>d</i>
COMMENT - Green sulfur bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-191412|) and green flimentous bacteria (|FRAME: TAX-1106|) contain chlorosomes - large organelles that are believed to be the most efficient light-harvesting antennae in nature |CITS: [20130996][Saga10]|. Green sulfur bacteria can grow at light intensities that are too low to support growth of any other phototroph, up to a million times lower light than normal sunlight |CITS: [Overmann92]|.
/
/Chlorosomes contain about 1,500 bacteriochlorophyll molecules per reaction center. They are filled with 1030 rod-shaped elements which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the chlorosomes and have a diameter of 10 nm. Each rod consists of a tubular bilayer formed by self-organization of the antenna bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Unlike all other known photosynthetic antenna, in which the chlorophyll molecules are bound to proteins, chlorosomes do not contain accessory proteins. The chlorosomal bacteriochlorophyll pigments are able to self-aggregate due to their unique chemical characteristics.
/
/The bacteriochlorophylls found in chlorosomes are either |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| or |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"|, depending on the species. They all possess a hydroxyl group at the C3<sup>1</sup> position that allows them to chelate the Mg atom of a neighboring molecule and to interact with the C13-oxo carbonyl group of another neighboring pigment molecule, affording the self-aggregation |CITS: [16121276][19435848][22210764]|. In addition, all of these bacteriochlorophylls lack C-13<sup>2</sup>-methylcarboxyl side chains, which are found in all other (bacterio)chlorophylls but would interfere with the ability to form aggregates |CITS: [16245042]|.
/
/Despite of their names, |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"|, |FRAME: CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"| and |FRAME: CPD-9094 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>e</i>"| are actually chlorins rather than bacteriochlorins. All three are usually found with an unsaturated farnesyl tail rather than phytyl tails |CITS: [2350541][Borrego99]|, although exceptions have been reported.
/
/In chlorosomes of |FRAME:  TAX-191412| (but not |FRAME: TAX-1106| |CITS: [Risch79][3442679]|) all three types of bacteriochlorophyll appear in several forms with different degrees of methylation at the C-8<sup>2</sup> and C-12<sup>1</sup> carbons |CITS: [12656478][14610639]|. The variety in methylation is depicted in the structure shown here by the R groups. In general, pimgents produced by cultures grown at lower light intensities are more highly methylated at the C-8<sup>2</sup> position than pigments produced by cells of the same organism grown at higher light intensities. Different methylation states result in different aggregation properties and light absorbance of the chlorosome, and thus methylation is used as an adaptation to altering envireonmental conditions. 
/
/Most of the green sulfur bacteria growing in stratified lakes contain |FRAME:CPD-9093 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>d</i>"|, and species containing |FRAME: CPD-9092 "bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i>"| are rarely found |CITS: [vanGemerden95]|.

COMMON-NAME - an O antigen
SYNONYMS - an O-specific polysaccharide
SYNONYMS - an O polysaccharide
SYNONYMS - an O side-chain
COMMENT - O-antigens are part of |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (|FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|), a |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, and polysaccharide side chains known as the <i>O</i>-antigen.
/
/The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of |FRAME: O-Antigen-Repeat-Units "repeating oligosaccharide subunits"| made up of two to eight sugar residues. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.
/
/The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered smooth or rough, respectively. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

UNIQUE-ID - Charged-tRNAs
TYPES - Modified-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a charged tRNA
SYNONYMS - an aminoacyl-tRNA
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - 2-phospho-ligated-tRNA
TYPES - tRNA-precursors
COMMON-NAME - a 2'-phospho-[ligated tRNA]
SYNONYMS - a tRNA with a 2'-phosphate
COMMENT - The processing of yeast tRNA starts when a tRNA endonuclease recognizes the |FRAME: tRNA-precursors "pre-tRNA"| and removes its intron, leaving a 5' tRNA half-molecule with a 2',3' cyclic phosphate on its 3' end and a 3' half-molecule with
/a hydroxyl on its 5' end. tRNA ligase then opens the 2',3' cyclic phosphate to a 2'-phosphate, phosphorylates the hydroxyl on the 3' half-molecule and joins the two halfmolecules to leave a mature length tRNA with a 2'-phosphate at the splice junction.

TYPES - MOD-PROT-CYS
COMMON-NAME - a [PqsD protein]-<i>S</i>-anthraniloyl-L-cysteine
COMMENT - PqsD from |FRAME: TAX-287| is a member of the FabH family of condensing enzymes that participates in the synthesis of the signal molecule |FRAME: CPD-12838| (see |FRAME: PWY-6660|) and of |FRAME: 4-hydroxy-2-1H-quinolone| (DHQ) , a molecule whose function is not yet known (see |FRAME: PWY-6661|).
/
/PqsD catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA| (anthraniloyl-CoA) with |FRAME: MALONYL-COA|. The enzyme forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate with |FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA|, which then reacts with |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to produce the short-lived thioester |FRAME: CPD-19113|. This compound forms a branch - in the absence of PqsE it is susceptible to spontaneous cyclization to form |FRAME: 4-hydroxy-2-1H-quinolone|. However, when PqsE is present, it removes the CoA moiety, forming |FRAME: CPD-19114| |CITS: [25960261]|.
/
/The enzyme activity was analyzed by TLC analysis of reaction mixtures containing |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| and [<sup>14</sup>C]|FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA|. Products were quantitated by LC-MS |CITS: [18728009]|.
/
/The crystal structure of recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes has been determined. The protein was found to be a homodimer and has structural similarities to a variety of condensing enzymes including |FRAME: EG10277| from |FRAME:TAX-562| (see |FRAME: CPLX0-252|) |CITS: [19694421]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [PqsC protein]-<i>S</i>-octanoyl-L-cysteine
COMMENT - PqsC is a member of the FabH family of enzymes. The enzyme acquires an octanoyl group from |FRAME: CPD-196|, and attaches it to a cysteine residue (C129). Together with PqsB, the proteins catalyze the coupling of |FRAME: CPD-19114| with the octanoate group, resulting in decarboxylation and the closing of the quinoline ring |CITS: [24239007]|.
/
/Both PqsB and PqsC are required for the reaction. The proteins form a tight complex. Attempts to produce PqsC from |FRAME: TAX-287| individually in |FRAME: TAX-562| failed, but coexpression of both genes yielded active proteins. When copurified His-tagged PqsB and PqsC are analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel, they produce one band even though their molecular weights differ |CITS: [24239007]|.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMENT - HypE is one of the hydrogenase maturation proteins required for the assembly of the CN ligand of the NiFe metal center of hydrogenases 1, 2 and 3.  
/
/At least seven gene products are involved in the maturation of hydrogenases in |FRAME: TAX-562|, which includes the generation and incorporation of the CN ligand from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| (CP). First, HypF converts CP and ATP to |FRAME: CPD-15424|, inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, and AMP |CITS: [12377778]|. It then transfers the carbamoyl group to the carboxy terminal cysteine of HypE |CITS: [12586941]|. During the carbamoyl transfer reaction, HypE and HypF form a tight stoichiometric complex |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE then catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis-dependent dehydration of the carbamate group to a cyanate group |CITS: [15291820][12586941]| which is transferred to the HypC-HypD complex |CITS: [15504408]| and from there to the hydrogenase.
/
/Purified HypE displays low intrinsic ATPase activity |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE can form a homodimer via a disulfide bridge formed by the C-terminal cysteine residue. It is unclear whether the disulfide-bridged dimer has biological significance |CITS: [15291820]|. A crystal structure of apo-HypE from <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 has been solved at 2 &Aring; resolution, and a reaction mechanism has been proposed |CITS: [18065529]|.

SYNONYMS - a tRNA(Sec)
SYNONYMS - a tRNA<sup>[Ser]Sec</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|.

UNIQUE-ID - CPD-20107
TYPES - Non-standard-amino-acids
COMMON-NAME - an oxyvinylglycine
COMMENT - Oxyvinylglycines are non-proteinogenic amino acids that are produced by certain bacteria. They irreversibly inhibit enzymes that require |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| as a co-factor and thus have multiple targets in bacteria, animals, and plants |CITS: [Berkowitz06]|.
/
/One such plant target is the ethylene biosynthesis enzyme |FRAME: EC-4.4.1.14|, which is inhibited by |FRAME: CPD-13353| (AVG) |CITS: [4850608][11230577][28293849]| and by |FRAME: CPD-20103| |CITS: [9925628]|. AVG is commercially available under the name of ReTain and is widely used for the regulation of fruit set in orchard crops.
/
/Another member of the oxyvinylglycines, |FRAME: CPD-20100| (FVG), is a natural herbicide that blocks the germination of a large variety of grassy weed species |CITS: [Banowetz08][23757135]|.

UNIQUE-ID - TusD-L-cysteine
TYPES - PROT-CYS
COMMON-NAME - a [TusD]-L-cysteine
COMMENT - |FRAME: TusD TusD| functions as a sulfur mediator during synthesis of 2-thiouridine of the modified wobble base mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U in tRNA. TusD forms a complex with TusB and TusC.
/
/Activated sulfur appears to be transferred from |FRAME: TusA TusA| to cysteine residue C78 in TusD |CITS: [16387657][16472754]|. The sulfur is subsequently transferred to |FRAME: Sulfur-Carrier-Proteins-TusE TusE|, which is known to stimulate the transfer of sulfur from TusA to TusD.  The TusBCD complex does not appear to bind tRNA directly in an <i>in vitro</i> assay, but it does interact with TusE |CITS: [16387657]|.
/
/A crystal structure of the TusBCD complex has been determined at 2.15 &Aring; resolution.  All three subunits show
/structural similarity to a protein of unknown function, YchN |CITS: [16472754]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PqsD PqsD| from |FRAME: TAX-287| is a member of the FabH family of condensing enzymes that participates in the synthesis of the signal molecule |FRAME: CPD-12838| (see |FRAME: PWY-6660|) and of |FRAME: 4-hydroxy-2-1H-quinolone| (DHQ) , a molecule whose function is not yet known (see |FRAME: PWY-6661|).
/
/PqsD catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA| (anthraniloyl-CoA) with |FRAME: MALONYL-COA|. The enzyme forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate with |FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA|, which then reacts with |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to produce the short-lived thioester |FRAME: CPD-19113|. This compound forms a branch - in the absence of PqsE it is susceptible to spontaneous cyclization to form |FRAME: 4-hydroxy-2-1H-quinolone|. However, when PqsE is present, it removes the CoA moiety, forming |FRAME: CPD-19114| |CITS: [25960261]|.
/
/The enzyme activity was analyzed by TLC analysis of reaction mixtures containing |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| and [<sup>14</sup>C]|FRAME: 2-AMINOBENZOYL-COA|. Products were quantitated by LC-MS |CITS: [18728009]|.
/
/The crystal structure of recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes has been determined. The protein was found to be a homodimer and has structural similarities to a variety of condensing enzymes including |FRAME: EG10277| from |FRAME:TAX-562| (see |FRAME: CPLX0-252|) |CITS: [19694421]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Cullins Cullins| are a family of proteins that provide a scaffold for some RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferases (|FRAME: EC-2.3.2.27 "EC 2.3.2.27"|), which are not able to bind a substrate protein directly. These E3 proteins form a complex with a cullin protein and a substrate recognition subunit (SRS). Some complexes also include an adaptor that links the SRS to the complex. The complexes are known as CRLs for Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligases.
/
/CRLs comprise the largest known category of ubiquitin ligases, and regulate an extensive number of dynamic cellular processes, including multiple aspects of the cell cycle, transcription, signal transduction, and development |CITS: [18282298]|. 
/
/There are five major types of cullins in metazoa, each of which forms a distinct class of CRL complex, with distinct adaptors and/or substrate-recognition subunits. CRLs are activated by the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein |FRAME: NEDD8 NEDD8| to the cullin, and are inhibited by binding to the CAND1 inhibitor |CITS: [15688063]|.
/
/The human genome contains eight cullin genes.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PqsC PqsC| is a member of the FabH family of enzymes. The enzyme acquires an octanoyl group from |FRAME: CPD-196|, and attaches it to a cysteine residue (C129). Together with PqsB, the proteins catalyze the coupling of |FRAME: CPD-19114| with the octanoate group, resulting in decarboxylation and the closing of the quinoline ring |CITS: [24239007]|.
/
/Both PqsB and PqsC are required for the reaction. The proteins form a tight complex. Attempts to produce PqsC from |FRAME: TAX-287| individually in |FRAME: TAX-562| failed, but coexpression of both genes yielded active proteins. When copurified His-tagged PqsB and PqsC are analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel, they produce one band even though their molecular weights differ |CITS: [24239007]|.

COMMENT - NEDD8-activating enzymes, also known as E1 enzymes, catalyze the first step in the neddylation process. The E1 enzyme, which is a herodimeric complex, binds ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> and |FRAME: NEDD8| and catalyzes C-terminal acyl adenylation of NEDD8. A catalytic L-cysteine residue of the E1 enzyme then attacks the NEDD8-AMP complex through acyl substitution, creating a thioester bond and an AMP leaving group.
/
/This active form of NEDD8, bound to the E1 enzyme, is transferred to |FRAME: NEDD8-carrier-proteins-E2| through a transthioesterification reaction, in which an E2 catalytic L-cysteine attacks the backside of the E1-NEDD8 complex.

SYNONYMS - a TAG(54:9)
COMMENT - This class of triacylglycerols contains three acyl chains formed by the esterification of glycerol with three fatty acids. The names of triacylglycerol compound classes provide information about the three acyl chains of each member of the class, using the nomenclature TAG(a:b/y:z) where "a" represents the number of carbons found in one acyl chain and "b" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "a" and where  "y" represents the total number of carbons found in the other two acyl chains and "z" represents the total number of desaturations present in the two chains included in "y." 
/
/Therefore, in this TAG(18:3/36:6) class of compounds, one acyl chain has 18 carbons and three double bonds. The other two acyl chains have a total of 36 carbons and six double bonds. The attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1 (sn-1), R2 (sn-2), or R3 (sn-3) position along the glyceryl backbone may vary among class members and cannot be inferred from their order in the compound class name. Additionally, the location and orientation of the double bonds in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may vary among members of the class and are not specified by this notation.

TYPES - C-terminal-L-Cysteine
COMMON-NAME - a [HypE hydrogenase maturation protein] C-terminal L-cysteine
SYNONYMS - a [HypE] C-terminal L-cysteine
COMMENT - HypE is one of the hydrogenase maturation proteins required for the assembly of the CN ligand of the NiFe metal center of hydrogenases 1, 2 and 3.  
/
/At least seven gene products are involved in the maturation of hydrogenases in |FRAME: TAX-562|, which includes the generation and incorporation of the CN ligand from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| (CP). First, HypF converts CP and ATP to |FRAME: CPD-15424|, inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, and AMP |CITS: [12377778]|. It then transfers the carbamoyl group to the carboxy terminal cysteine of HypE |CITS: [12586941]|. During the carbamoyl transfer reaction, HypE and HypF form a tight stoichiometric complex |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE then catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis-dependent dehydration of the carbamate group to a cyanate group |CITS: [15291820][12586941]| which is transferred to the HypC-HypD complex |CITS: [15504408]| and from there to the hydrogenase.
/
/Purified HypE displays low intrinsic ATPase activity |CITS: [15291820]|. HypE can form a homodimer via a disulfide bridge formed by the C-terminal cysteine residue. It is unclear whether the disulfide-bridged dimer has biological significance |CITS: [15291820]|. A crystal structure of apo-HypE from <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 has been solved at 2 &Aring; resolution, and a reaction mechanism has been proposed |CITS: [18065529]|.

/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

/Therefore, in this TAG(18:3/36:0) class of compounds, one acyl chain has 18 carbons and three double bonds. The other two acyl chains have a total of 36 carbons and zero double bonds. The attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1 (sn-1), R2 (sn-2), or R3 (sn-3) position along the glyceryl backbone may vary among class members and cannot be inferred from their order in the compound class name. Additionally, the location and orientation of the double bonds in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may vary among members of the class and are not specified by this notation.

UNIQUE-ID - Ceramide-NdS
TYPES - CPD3DJ-82
COMMON-NAME - a ceramide NdS
SYNONYMS - a ceramide 10
SYNONYMS - a Cer 10
COMMENT - The human skin outermost layer (the stratum corneum) contains 12 main types of free ceramides.
/Two nomenclature systems have been used for the description of these ceramides. The older numbering system is based on the chromatographic migration (ceramide 1 to ceramide 8) and chronological arrangement of their publication (from ceramide 9 and on). A newer system is based on the molecular structure |CITS: [8357845][7868984]|. In this system each ceramide type is named by two or three letters, where the front letter(s) designate the acyl chain: N (non-hydroxy fatty acid), A (&alpha;-hydroxy fatty acid), O (&omega;--hydroxy fatty acid, or EO (an &omega;-hydroxy fatty acid esterified to linoleic acid), and the last letter designates the sphingoid base: S (|FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|), dS (|FRAME: CPD-13612 sphinganine|), P (|FRAME: PHYTOSPINGOSINE|), or H (|FRAME: CPD-22027|).
/
/The 12 types of free stratum corneum ceramides are |FRAME: Ceramide-EOS| (ceramide 1), |FRAME: Ceramide-NS| (ceramide 2), |FRAME: Ceramide-NP| (ceramide 3), |FRAME: Ceramide-EOH| (ceramide 4), |FRAME: Ceramide-AS| (ceramide 5), |FRAME: Ceramide-AP| (ceramide 6), |FRAME: Ceramide-AH| (ceramide 7), |FRAME: Ceramide-NH| (ceramide 8), |FRAME: Ceramide-EOP| (ceramide 9), ,|FRAME: Ceramide-NdS| (ceramide 10), |FRAME: Ceramide-AdS| (ceramide 11), and |FRAME: Ceramide-EOdS| (ceramide 12) |CITS: [7868984][18329855][23954553]|. The four EO types, |FRAME: Ceramide-EOS|, |FRAME: Ceramide-EOH|, |FRAME: Ceramide-EOP|, and |FRAME: Ceramide-EOdS|, are also known as |FRAME: Linoleate-Acylceramides acylceramides|.
/
/The four O-type ceramides of the stratum corneum are not found among the free ceramides, as they form an ester-linkage via their &omega;-hydroxyl group to to glutamate residues of proteins in the cornified envelope |CITS: [27432202]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Globo-H
TYPES - Globo-Series-GSLs
COMMON-NAME - globo H
COMMENT - The Globo-H antigen was first isolated from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in 1983 |CITS: [ 6863318]|. Globo H is overexpressed on a variety of epithelial cell tumors such as colon, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancers. Patients with Globo H-positive tumors show a shorter survival in comparison to patients with Globo H-negative tumors |CITS: [2554552]|.
/
/Since globo H is not expressed in normal tissue except for weak expression in the apical epithelial cells at lumen borders, a site that is inaccessible to the immune system |CITS: [6711680][9334808]|, it is considered an ideal target for immunotherapy of many epithelial cancers. Two phase I trials of a Globo H-based vaccine in breast and prostate cancer, respectively, have shown promising results  |CITS: [10318949][11248068]|, and efforts to develop a globo H cancer vaccine are continues |CITS: [25665650]|.

SYNONYMS - a P histo-blood group antigen
SYNONYMS - T lymphocyte macrophage-associated antigen
SYNONYMS - TLMA
SYNONYMS - Gb4Cer
COMMENT - Originally, the name "globoside" was used as a generic name for the mucolipids present on human erythrocytes |CITS: [Yamakawa52]|. Later it was used for mucolipids possessing hexosamines as the only nitrogen-containing sugars. A structural analysis of the main component of the mucolipids identifed it as |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GALACTOSAMINYL-13-D-GALACT globotetraosylceramide| |CITS: [14002302][14002301]| and today the term globoside is a synonym for that compound.

SYNONYMS - a GlcCer
SYNONYMS - a glucosyl ceramide
COMMENT - Cerebrosides consist of |FRAME: Ceramides| with a single sugar residue at the 1-hydroxyl moiety. The sugar residue can be either glucose or galactose, and the two major types are thus named |FRAME: Glucosyl-ceramides glucocerebrosides| and |FRAME: D-galactosylceramide galactocerebrosides|. Galactocerebrosides are typically found in neural tissue, while glucocerebrosides are found in other tissues.
/
/Based on the notation GlcCer(m:n)-p used to name subclasses of glucosylceramides, the total number of carbons present in the sphingoid base and the fatty amide is "m" while the total number of double bonds is "n." The total number of hydroxyl groups (not including the hydroxyl group used as the site of the head group attachment) is "p." The length, hydroxylation position, double bond position, and double bond orientation of the groups attached at R1 and R2 will differ between individual members of this group of compounds.

TYPES - Inositol-Phosphoceramides
COMMON-NAME - a glycosylinositol phosphoceramide
SYNONYMS - a GIPC
COMMENT - Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs) are found only in plants, fungi, and some protozoa. For GIPC biosynthesis, |FRAME: Ceramides| is trafficked to the Golgi, where a phosphorylinositol headgroup is added to form |FRAME: Inositol-Phosphoceramides| (IPC) by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.227| (IPC synthase) |CITS: [19001565]|. The IPC core can then be glycosylated by various glycosyltransferases to produce mature GIPCs |CITS: [27895225]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of IPCs is well conserved between plants and fungi |CITS: [15037448]|. However, plant GIPCs are more highly glycosylated than those in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, usually containing &alpha;-glucuronate linked to the IPC core structure, to which additional sugar units such as glucosamine (GlcN), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), mannose (Man), and arabinose (Ara) may be attached |CITS: [16772288][21953969][23499054]|. 
/
/In this class of glycosylinositol phosphoceramides, a long carbon chain is attached at position R1 to form a fatty amide and a long carbon chain is attached at position R2 to form a long chain base. Either or both of these chains may contain one or more double bonds and may have hydroxyl groups attached.
/
/To describe subclasses of this class, the following notation is used: GIPC(m:n)-p. The total number of carbons present in the sphingoid base and the fatty amide is "m" while the total number of double bonds is "n." The total number of hydroxyl groups (not including the hydroxyl group used as the site of the head group attachment) is "p."

UNIQUE-ID - C-Series-Gangliosides
TYPES - Ganglio-Series-GSLs
TYPES - Gangliosides
COMMON-NAME - a c-series ganglioside
COMMENT - c-Series gangliosides are formed during mammalian brain development where they are thought to be involved in growth, differentiation, and migration of neuronal cells. They are abundant in fish brain, and in adult rats; they occur in liver, kidney, and pancreas |CITS: [10699494]| and in tumors such as glioma.
/
/<b>About the nomenclature of gangliosides</b>
/
/Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.
/
/A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.
/The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).
/
/In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides a-series|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides b-series|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a b and c in their names.
/
/So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

/
/The inverted m7G, which is also known as a cap0 structure, marks transcription start sites, and has multiple effects on gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation initiation, as facilitated by interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding proteins.

/The cap0 structure is present on all eukaryotic mRNAs and is essential for cell growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and survival of mammalian cells |CITS: [21310715]|.

/The |FRAME: FORSSMAN-HAPTEN "Forssman hapten"| (Fs), which was described in 1911 |CITS: [Forssman11]|, is one of the most potent haptenic sphingoglycolipids |CITS: [13239189][14241772][4538505][4199759][4459265]|.
/Primates, including humans, lack Fs synthase activity, and have naturally occurring Fs antibodies in plasma. However, some individuals with the enigmatic ABO subgroup A<sub>pae</sub> were shown to expressed Fs glycolipids on their erythrocites |CITS: [23255552]|. The compound was also reported from human tumors |CITS: [4634984]|.
/
/Primates and humans have a gene that encodes the Fs synthase, but it encodes an inactive protein |CITS: [10506200]|. In individuals that do express the Fs antigen, the |FRAME: HS07505| gene contains a mutation that results in an arginine to glutamine change at residue 296. Transfection experiments and molecular modeling showed that the Agr296Gln mutation reactivates the human Fs synthase. Based on these findings, the authors suggested to name a new histo-blood group system in man, FORS |CITS: [23255552]|.

TYPES - Gangliosides
COMMON-NAME - a b-series ganglioside
COMMENT - <b>About the nomenclature of gangliosides</b>
/
/Ganglioside naming is somewhat complex. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use. The most commonly used is a short-hand nomenclature suggested by Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio-series"| gangliosides in chromatography |CITS: [14066623]|. The more comprehensive system formulated by IUPAC |CITS: [9826173]| is applied much less frequently.
/
/A typical ganglioside name using the old system looks like |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"|.
/The first letter refers to the glycosphingolipid series. For example, the "G" stands for the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|. The next letter describes the number of sialic acid residues: (A = 0, M =1, D = 2, T = 3, Q = 4, P = 5, H = 6, S = 7). The following number describes the number of the non-sialic residues, and is derived in a rather complex manner. It was initially assumed that the number of such residues does not exceed 5. The number in the name was calculated as (5 - the number of uncharged carbohydrates).
/
/In addition, several sub-series of gangliosides have been defined based on the number of sialic acids attached to the galactose residue of the lacosylceramide core. If no sialic residues are present at that position, the compounds belong to the |FRAME: 0-Series-Ganglioside "0-series|. Those with one sialic acid at that position are named the |FRAME: A-Series-Gangliosides a-series|, those with two sialic acids belong to the |FRAME: B-Series-Gangliosides b-series|, and so on. |FRAME: C-Series-Gangliosides "C-series"| or higher gangliosides are rare in adult mammals and birds, but are abundant in fish and amphibians. Confusingly,  GM1b and GD1c are both 0-series gangliosides, despite having a b and c in their names.
/
/So, for example, the |FRAME: Ganglioside-GQ1b "ganglioside GQ1b"| is named as follows: G = belongs to the ganglio series, Q =  4 sialic acids, 1 = 4 non-sialic residues, and b = belongs to the b-series, meaning two of the sialic acids are attached to the inner galactose.

UNIQUE-ID - Hemicelluloses
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - hemicellulose
COMMENT - Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.
/
/The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
/Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.
/
/Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.
/
/Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
/However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.
/D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: 1-4-Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.
/
/Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.
/
/Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Carboxymethylcellulose Carboxymethylcellulose| (CMC) is a |FRAME: CELLULOSE| derivative with carboxymethyl groups bound to some of the hydroxyl groups of the glucopyranose monomers that make up the cellulose backbone. All available positions, O2, O3, and O6, can be modified. It is often used as its sodium salt, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Unlike unmodified cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose is soluble in water.
/
/CMC is used in food science as a viscosity modifier or thickener, and to stabilize emulsions in various products including ice cream. It is also a constituent of many non-food products, such as K-Y Jelly, toothpaste, laxatives, diet pills, water-based paints, detergents, textile sizing and various paper products.

SYNONYMS - a jasmonyl isoleucine
COMMENT - Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has been detected in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [15258265]| and a number of other plant
/species |CITS: [18812165][SEMBDER93][17273867]|. There are two different naturally occurring stereoisomers of this
/compound, |FRAME: CPD-11232| and |FRAME:CPD-11259|, that can spontaneously interconvert through epimerization
/|CITS: [19349968]|. 
/
/In Arabidopsis thaliana, JA-Ile promotes binding between the COI1 F-box protein and the JAZ1 repressor involved
/in jasmonic acid-mediated signaling |CITS: [17637677]|. Therefore, JA-Ile promotes the degradation of JAZ1.
/Initial studies suggested that |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"| was a biologically active phytohormone
/|CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
/later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
/]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
/biological activity originally associated with |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"|. A pure preparation of that stereoisomer
/does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.
/
/JA-Ile has also been detected in |FRAME: TAX-49451| and plays a role in defense responses |CITS: [17085687]|

/
/It has been reported that, unlike JA-Ile, JA-Phe does not promote interaction between the JAZ1/JAZ3 and COI1 proteins from tomato <i>in vitro</i>. However, the compound used was mixture of synthetic (+)-JA-Phe and (-)-JA-Phe diastereomers, and did not include the naturally-occuring |FRAME: CPD-19817| |CITS: [18458331]|. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-11235| [(-)-JA-L-Phe] was tested for its activity in |FRAME: TAX-3702| using three different assays, and did not show any biological activity |CITS: [19349968]| (supplementary materials). On the other hand,  (-)-JA-L-Phe was reported to elicit strongly the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin |FRAME: CPD-7079| in rice |CITS:[9013895]|.
/
/It is possible that the other stereoisomer, |FRAME: CPD-19817|, might have some biological activity (as is the case for |FRAME: CPD-11259| vs. |FRAME: CPD-11232|) |CITS: [19349968]|.

A mixture of these compounds, sold as "senna", is widely used as a purgative, laxative, expectorant, wound dresser, antidysentric, and carminative.
/
/Four types of sennosides (|FRAME: CPD-21671|, |FRAME: CPD-21672|, |FRAME: CPD-21673|, and |FRAME: CPD-21674|) are present in large quantities in leaves (2.0&ndash;3.0%) and pods (3.0&ndash;4.0%) of the plant. |FRAME: CPD-21671| and |FRAME: CPD-21672| are homo-dianthrones (dimers of two similar anthrone moieties) of |FRAME: CPD-21676| anthrone whereas |FRAME: CPD-21673| and |FRAME: CPD-21674| are hetro-dianthrones, composed of |FRAME: CPD-21676| and |FRAME: CPD-21677| anthrones. Sennoside A and B contribute for around 80% of the biological activity of senna.
/
/In plant, the sennosides are absent in fresh parts and form only during post harvest drying |CITS: [17401811]|. The laxative activity of senna is caused by interaction of the sennosides on the large intestine to stimulate peristalsis (the muscular activity of the colon leading to elimination) |CITS: [8234422]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/
/Please note that tyhe structure shown here is that of |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE-9| and is not accurate for this generic class of compounds, which contains plastoquinones with different side-chain lengths.

UNIQUE-ID - Rhodoquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a rhodoquinone
COMMENT - Rhodoquinone (RQ) is a modified ubiquinone, where the methoxyl group in position 3 is replaced by an

/[14285535]|, where is it used for the reduction of fumarate to succinate under anaerobic conditions.
/
/Rhodoquinone is not limited to prokaryotes. It was soon discovered that some eukaryotic parasites such

/parasitic helminths |CITS:[4795616]| also contain rhodoquinone, which is essential for fumarate
/reduction under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[2843227]|. Later it was shown that

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a ubiquinone
SYNONYMS - coenzyme-Q<SUB>n</SUB>
SYNONYMS - ubiquinone
SYNONYMS - Q
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

COMMENT - Several methylated or demethylated forms of menaquinone have been identified, including 8-methylmenaquinone, which is found in a diverse range of microorganisms such as members of the bacterial phyla |FRAME: TAX-201174 Actinobacteria| and |FRAME: TAX-1224 Proteobacteria| as well as the archaeal phyla |FRAME: TAX-28889 Crenarchaeota| and |FRAME: TAX-28890 Euryarchaeota| |CITS: [6663282][3937542][2312688][26472620][28164386]|. The addition of methyl groups to menaquinone shifts the redox potential to more negative values |CITS: [Schmid99][19265668]|, making these derivatives good redox mediators in electron transport chainsthat use low-potential electron acceptors such as polysulfide or sulfite |CITS: [11856339]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - Modified-Menaquinones
COMMON-NAME - a 2-demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit |CITS: [9363431][21091511]|.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaea prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.
/
/Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra |FRAME: CPD-12419| |CITS: [15686500]|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol, containing 16 isoprene units.

COMMON-NAME - a fucoidan
COMMENT - Fucoidan is a generic term used to describe sulfated polysaccharides (MW: average 20,000) found in various species of brown algae such as kombu (edible kelp from mostly the family |FRAME: TAX-33636|), limu moui (|FRAME: TAX-86906|), bladder wrack (|FRAME: TAX-49266|), wakame (|FRAME: TAX-74381|), mozuku (|FRAME: TAX-309737|), and hijiki (|FRAME: TAX-590727|).
/
/Fucoidan was first reported in 1913 under the name fucoidin |CITS: [Kylin13]|, but the name was changed in 1959 to  conform with polysaccharide nomenclature |CITS: [McNeely59]|.
/
/Fucoidan structure can be divided into two groups depending on their sources: one group includes |FRAME: TAX-33637| species that have their central chains composed by (1&rarr;3)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [8408031]|; a second group includes fucoidan isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52968| and |FRAME: TAX-3011| species that have their central chains composed of repeating (1&rarr;3) and (1&rarr;4) linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11269406][21566795]|. Besides fucose and sulfate, the presence of monosaccharide residues such as mannose, galactose, glucose, xylose and uronic acids were also identified |CITS: [18794778]|.
/
/Several fucose-containing polymers with less than 90% fucosyl residues have also been reported from brown algae and some of them were given names: ascophyllan or xylofucoglycuronan, isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on a backbone of mannuronate with branches of 3-<i>O</i>-D-xylosyl-L-fucose-4-sulfate |CITS: [Larsen66][Kloareg86]|; sargassan or glycuronofucoglycan, also isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on linear chains of D-galactose with branches of L-fucose-3-sulfate or occasionally uronate |CITS: [Percival68][Medcalf78][Kloareg86]|. Other, generic names in use are F-fucoidan, which consists of mostly fucose |CITS: [23374164]|, U-fucoidan, which contains approximately 20% of glucuronic acid, and G-fucoidan, which contains a substantial amount of galactose |CITS: [20138103]|.

COMMENT - Fucan is a generic term used to define a family of |FRAME: L-fucoses|-containing sulfated polysaccharides with extremely variable molecular weights that are produced by brown algae (|FRAME: TAX-2870|) |CITS: [Kylin13]| and marine vertebrates |CITS: [Vasseur48]|. It has been recommended to use this term to refer to polysaccharide based mainly on sulfated L-fucose, with less than 10% other monosaccharides |CITS: [12626402]|.
/
/In marine invertebrates, sulfated fucans have been found in the egg jelly coat of sea urchins |CITS: [Vasseur48][8071336]| and in the body wall of sea cucumber |CITS: [3038547]|. In brown algae the fucan is present in the cell walls and can account for more than 40% of the dry weight of isolated cell walls |CITS: [Kloareg84]|. The fucans of brown algae are often called |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|.
/
/The structures of fucans vary among species and sometimes among different parts of the organism |CITS: [Dietrich95]|. Fucan structures can be divided into three main groups: one group, found in |FRAME: TAX-33637| species of brown algae  and several species of sea urchines, has a central chain composed of (1&rarr;3)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [8408031]|; a second group, found so far only in the sea urchins |FRAME: TAX-7640| and |FRAME: TAX-7671|, has a central chain composed of (1&rarr;4)-linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11687579]|; the third group, which includes fucoidan isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52968| and |FRAME: TAX-3011| species of brown algae, has a central chain composed of repeating (1&rarr;3) and (1&rarr;4) linked &alpha;-L-fucopyranose residues |CITS: [11269406][21566795]|. Besides fucose and sulfate, the presence of monosaccharide residues such as mannose, galactose, glucose, xylose and uronic acids were also identified |CITS: [18794778]|.
/
/Several fucose-containing polymers with less than 90% fucosyl residues have also been reported from brown algae and some of them were given names: ascophyllan or xylofucoglycuronan, isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on a backbone of mannuronate with branches of 3-<i>O</i>-D-xylosyl-L-fucose-4-sulfate |CITS: [Larsen66][Kloareg86]|; sargassan or glycuronofucoglycan, also isolated from |FRAME: TAX-52969|, is based on linear chains of D-galactose with branches of L-fucose-3-sulfate or occasionally uronate |CITS: [Percival68][Medcalf78][Kloareg86]|. However, those are classified as sub-types of fucoidan and not fucan, due to the large percentage of non-fucose saccharides.

UNIQUE-ID - Teichoic-Acids
TYPES - Polysaccharide-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - a teichoic acid
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids

COMMON-NAME - a long-chain fatty acid
SYNONYMS - LCFA
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMON-NAME - a 2,3,4-saturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail. This class describes |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "fatty acids"| that do not contain any double bonds in the 2, 3, and 4 positions. The compounds in this class are often classified by the length of their aliphatic chains.
/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-234-Saturated-Fatty-Acids "Short-chain 2,3,4-saturated fatty acids"| are 2,3,4-saturated fatty acids with aliphatic chains of less than 6 carbons.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an unsaturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan-tetraose
TYPES - Xyloglucan-oligosaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan cellotetraose
COMMENT - Xyloglucan is the major hemicellulose in dicotyledon type I cell walls and has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked cellotetraose units, which are substituted in C-6 by a-D-xylosyl residues at two or three of the first three glucosyl residues (from the reducing end) |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by galactosyl, arabinosyl or fucosyls residues |CITS: [Fry93]|. The cross-linking between xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the three-dimensional matrix between adjacent cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/
/A common terminology refers to a glucosyl unit within a xylosylglycan as G and to a glucose residues substituted by D-xylose in a (1,6)-&alpha;-linkage as X.
/Using this terminology, most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide XXXG units.

UNIQUE-ID - Lewis-Antigen
TYPES - Oligosaccharide-Protein-or-Lipid
COMMON-NAME - a Lewis epitope
SYNONYMS - a Lewis antigen
COMMENT - The Lewis blood group antigens, discovered in 1946, are biosynthetically and structurally related carbohydrate structures used as markers of cell differentiation and embryonic development, based on fucosylation carried by a number of fucosyltransferases. The system is named after Mrs. H. D. G. Lewis, in whose serum the first member of the family was discovered |CITS: [20995492]|. However, the presence of the Lewis antigens is not limited to erytrocytes, and they are found in different tissues and organs.
/
/One of these fucosyltransferases, encoded by the |FRAME: HS10249| gene, is bifunctional and can fucosylate both the 3 and 4 positions of the penultimate sugar in the precursor disaccharide. The gene, also known as the Lewis gene, has a dominant allele (which was named Le) and a recessive non-functional allele (known as le). The &alpha;(1,4)-fucosyltransferase activity is only relevant when the substrates are derived from the |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharide"|, as that position is already occupied in the |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R "type 2 disaccharide"|.
/
/The first Lewis antigens to be discovered were the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope "Lewis a"| and |FRAME: Antigen-Leb "Lewis b"| antigens, which are produced from |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharides"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7832|). However, the &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| leads to formation of several related antigens known as the |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x epitope"| (also known as SSEA-1, for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1), |FRAME: Antigen-Ley "Lewis y epitope"|, and the |FRAME: sLea-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis x epitope"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7831|).

UNIQUE-ID - LysW-C-Terminal-L-Glutamate

COMMON-NAME - an [amino-group carrier protein]-C-terminal-L-glutamate
COMMENT - LysW is an amino group carrier protein used by many archaebacterial species for the synthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: LYS|. 
/
/The amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, an intermediate in the archaeal L-lysine biosynthetic pathway (which is also found in the hyperthermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-274|), is covalently linked to the &gamma;-carboxyl group of the last C-terminal residue of LysW (Glu54 in |FRAME: TAX-274|) by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5207| gene. LysW not only protects the amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, but also serves as a carrier protein, which is easily recognized by lysine biosynthesis enzymes. In this way all subsequent transformations leading to L-lyine occur when the amino acid is attached to LysW, and the |FRAME: CPD-468| side chain is converted to a C-terminal lysyl side chain in the LysW-conjugated form. Eventually, a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5222| gene releases the mature amino acid |CITS: [19620981]|.
/
/It has been shown that at least in |FRAME: TAX-2284| LysW is also used as a carrier protein for |FRAME: GLT| during the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ARG| |CITS: [23434852]|.

COMMON-NAME - an archaeal dolichyl 3-O-(2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-&beta;-D-glucuronsyl)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosaminyl phosphate
COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain archaea contain additional saturations |CITS: [9363431][21091511][ 22469971][21745590]|.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C55 dolichol, containing 11 isoprene units, unsaturated at both the &alpha; and &omega; isoprene units, which is typical to some archaea.

SYNONYMS - Advil
SYNONYMS - Nurofen
SYNONYMS - Nuprin
COMMENT - Ibuprofen is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.
/Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.
/Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).
/
/Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.
/
/The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| <i>in vivo</i> to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

SYNONYMS - heparan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Heparosan "Heparosan"| (also known as heparan) is a member of the |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| family. It consists of a repeating disaccharide unit composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521|-(1,4)-|FRAME: CPD-12541|. The disaccharide units are linked by a (1-4) linkage to each other.
/
/Heparosan is a bacterial glycosaminoglycan produced and found in the capsule of some pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli K5 and Pasteurella multocida.
/
/The heparosan skeleton serves as a starting point in the biosynthesis of several other glycosaminoglycan such as |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| and |FRAME: HEPARIN|, and bacterial heparosan is sometimes used for the synthesis of non-animal sourced heparin-like products.

UNIQUE-ID - Hyaluronan
TYPES - Glucosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - hyaluronan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Hyaluronan Hyaluronan| is an anionic, nonsulfated |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues, including the vitreous humor of the eye, the aorta, blood, brain, liver and skin |CITS: [354500]|. It is produced by almost all members of the animal kingdom as well as by certain members of streptococci |CITS: [9260563]|. Hyaluronan can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions. It forms a strikingly viscous solution and functions primarily as a joint lubricant and shock absorber, although it is also thought to be involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
/
/Hyaluronan is composed of repeating disaccharide unit of [|FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (&beta;1,4) |FRAME: CPD-12521|] (|FRAME: HYALURONATE|) linked by &beta; 1,3 linkages. 
/
/Though classified as a glycosaminoglycan, it differs from other members of this family. While all other glycosaminoglycans are synthesized by resident Golgi enzymes and covalently attached to core proteins, hyaluronan is synthesized at the inner face of the plasma membrane as a free linear polymer without any protein core. In addition, it is the only glycosaminoglycan that is not sulfated |CITS: [17408700]|.

UNIQUE-ID - HEPARIN
TYPES - Glucosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - heparin
SYNONYMS - enoxaparin
COMMENT - |FRAME: HEPARIN "Heparin"| is a glycosaminoglycan polymer with a molecular weight ranging from 3 to 30 kDa. It is composed of a variable sulfated repeating disaccharide units composed of hexuronic (either iduronic or glucuronic) acid and glucosamine residues, in which the 2 position of the hexuronic acid and the 2, 3, or 6 positions of glucosamine may be sulfated. The two residuces within a disaccharide are linked by a (1->4) bond, as are the disaccharides to each other.
/
/The main disaccharide unit consists of |FRAME: CPD-12518| and |FRAME: CPD-12533| [it is often referred to as IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S)]. However, |FRAME: CPD-12518| can be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12521|, and |FRAME: CPD-12533| can be replaced by |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine|, |FRAME: CPD-12545| or |FRAME: CPD-12565|.
/
/The basic IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharide accounts for at least 85% of heparin isolated from beef lung and about 75% of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa |CITS: [Casu89][Gatti79]|.
/
/Variations in the extent and location of sulfation, as well as the conformation of the alternating hexuronic acid residues, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity. By convention, heparin refers to molecules which possess a high sulfate content and large amounts of iduronic acid.
/
/The structure of |FRAME: HEPARIN| is very similar to that of |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| (also known as heparitin sulfate). Heparan sulfate contains lower amounts of sulfate and less iduronic acid than heparin |CITS: [5484472]|. In addition, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains, while heparin disaccharides are sulfated more uniformly |CITS: [15047699]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| (also known as heparitin sulfate)  is a member of the |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| family. It consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit composed of a hexuronic acid and a hexosamine.
/The most common repeating unit, which makes up around 50% of the total disaccharide units in heparan sulfate, is composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521| linked to |FRAME: CPD-12541|. In other units |FRAME: CPD-12521| may be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12515| or its sulfated form |FRAME: CPD-12518|, and |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| may be sulfated to |FRAME: CPD-12565|, or may be substituted by |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine| or |FRAME: CPD-12533|.
/
/Heparan sulfate binds to specific proteins such as antithrombin and several growth factors, thereby regulating various biological processes including anticoagulation and angiogenesis |CITS: [9151776]|. The unique sulfation pattern of a monosaccharide sequence within HS is believed to be critical for binding to the target protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an ultra-long-chain fatty acid
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

UNIQUE-ID - Medium-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Medium-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a medium chain fatty acid
SYNONYMS - MCFA
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMON-NAME - a histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharide
COMMENT - The histo-blood group antigen precursor disaccharides are found at the terminal end of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins or sphingolipids, and serve as the actual substrates for various glycosyltransferases that terminate the chain elongation process, forming the ABH or Lewis antigens.
/
/Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.
/Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.
/
/Since ABH antigens are present not only on erythrocytes, but also on various organs such as the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [3965299][6172274]|, they are called histo-blood group ABH antigens.
/
/Six types of precursor disaccharides have been described:

UNIQUE-ID - L-methionyl-tRNAfmet
TYPES - Charged-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an L-methionyl-[initiator tRNA<SUP>Met</SUP>]
SYNONYMS - an L-methionyl-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-methionyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group |CITS: [1103137]|.

COMMENT - The human skin outermost layer (the stratum corneum) contains 12 main types of free ceramides.
/Two nomenclature systems have been used for the description of these ceramides. The older numbering system is based on the chromatographic migration (ceramide 1 to ceramide 8) and chronological arrangement of their publication (from ceramide 9 and on). A newer system is based on the molecular structure |CITS: [8357845][7868984]|. In this system each ceramide type is named by two or three letters, where the front letter(s) designate the acyl chain: N (non-hydroxy fatty acid), A (&alpha;-hydroxy fatty acid), O (&omega;--hydroxy fatty acid, or EO (an &omega;-hydroxy fatty acid esterified to linoleic acid), and the last letter designates the sphingoid base: S (|FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|), dS (|FRAME: CPD-13612 sphinganine|), P (|FRAME: PHYTOSPINGOSINE|), or H (|FRAME: CPD-22027|).

UNIQUE-ID - Short-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Short-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a short chain fatty acid
SYNONYMS - SCFA
SYNONYMS - a volatile fatty acid
SYNONYMS - VFA
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

SYNONYMS - a triacylglyceride(18:2/36:0)
SYNONYMS - a TAG(54:2)
COMMENT - This class of triacylglycerols contains three acyl chains formed by the esterification of glycerol with three fatty acids. The names of triacylglycerol compound classes provide information about the three acyl chains of each member of the class, using the nomenclature TAG(a:b/y:z) where "a" represents the number of carbons found in one acyl chain and "b" represents the number of desaturations present in chain "a" and where  "y" represents the total number of carbons found in the other two acyl chains and "z" represents the total number of desaturations present in the two chains included in "y." 
/
/Therefore, in this TAG(18:2/36:0) class of compounds, one acyl chain has 18 carbons and two double bonds. The other two acyl chains have a total of 36 carbons and no double bonds. The attachment sites of the acyl chains at the R1 (sn-1), R2 (sn-2), or R3 (sn-3) position along the glyceryl backbone may vary among class members and cannot be inferred from their order in the compound class name. Additionally, the location and orientation of the double bonds in the unsaturated acyl chain(s) may vary among members of the class and are not specified by this notation.

UNIQUE-ID - Xylans
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - xylan
COMMENT - Xylan is a general name given for polysaccharides composed of xylose residues. It is the principal type of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in plant biomass representing the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after |FRAME: CELLULOSE| |CITS: [20113432]|.
/
/The most common form of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan|, which is found in the cell walls of plants and some algae. 
/Pure |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan "(1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is uncommon. In most cases it is decorated with additional sugars, in the form of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylan| or |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylan|.
/
/The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source. Arabinose and glucuronic acid are linked to the backbone by glycosidic bonds. Other substituents form ester bonds: acetate groups are bound directly to the backbone, while cinnamoyl (feruloyl and coumaroyl) residues are linked to the side chain arabinoses |CITS: [JOSELEAU]|.
/
/Due to its heterogeneous structure, the biodegradation of xylan requires the concerted action of a complex set of enzymes |CITS: [17008082]|. These enzymes are mainly extracellular and are secreted by numerous fungi and bacteria |CITS: [BIELY]|. The endoxylanases and &beta; xylosidases hydrolyze the main chain; the former generating short chain oligosaccharides and the latter acting on these products to liberate xylose. The side chains are hydrolyzed by glycanases, &alpha;-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases and feruloyl esterases |CITS: [11729262]|.
/
/|FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "(1->3)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is found only in cell walls of some red and green algae.

UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledon plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50,000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/A common form of xyloglucan that is often used in enzyme assays is produced from tamarind (|FRAME: TAX-58860|) seeds.

UNIQUE-ID - Plant-Arabinogalactans
TYPES - Arabinogalactan
COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans are biopolymers consisting of arabinose and galactose residues. Two main classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "plant arabinogalactan"| and |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"|.
/
/|FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "Plant arabinogalactans"| (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.
/
/AG of type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|.

UNIQUE-ID - CPD0-1099
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a colanic acid
SYNONYMS - an M antigen
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"| is an exopolysaccharide secreted by |FRAME: TAX-562| and a number of other |FRAME: TAX-543| that encapsulates the organism, resulting in a mucoid appearance |CITS: [13963285]|. Colanic acid is thought to promote biofilm formation and to protect the organism when exposed to harsh environments such as acidic conditions |CITS:  [11371548][16706906]|.
/
/Even though it wasn't identified as such, colanic acid was first described in 1927 by Dorothea Smith, who isolated a polysaccharide from a mucoid strain of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [19869322]|. Fourteen years later, in a study on the antigens of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, it was noticed that one antigen was common to several mucoid strains of |FRAME: TAX-57045| |CITS: [Kauffmann41]|. It was soon reported that the same antigen, which was named "M" antigen, is produced by mucoid <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains |CITS: [15406247]|. In 1954 Kauffmann reported that the antigen was common to all mucoid <i>Salmonella</i> species |CITS: [Kauffmann54]|.
/
/Similar exopolysaccharides were reported from a number of mucoid strains and species |CITS: [13475241][13641209][13963285][14073028][5324934]|. In the early 60s it was reported that a large number of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> strains that are not normally mucoid can be induced to form slime exopolysaccharides when grown at 15 to 20&deg;C in high phosphate concentration |CITS: [Anderson61][Anderson63]|, and the exopolysaccharide was named "colanic acid" after |FRAME: TAX-562| from which it was isolated |CITS: [13963285]|. In a paper describing the discovery of the same polysaccharide in |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was suggested that colanic acid and the "M antigen" reported in the earlier studies are identical |CITS: [14206589]|. A confirmation was obtained in 1969 when it was shown that colanic acid of identical composition is produced by strains from the genera <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia</i>, and <i>Aerobacter</i>. At that time the exact structure was not known, though it was known that the polysaccharide contains glucose, galactose, fucose, and glucuronate, as well as some <i>O</i>-acetyl groups |CITS: [ 4902806]|.
/
/Additional structural studies have shown that colanic acid from different organisms is very similar, with the polysaccharide composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose, two fucoses, two galactoses, and glucuronate. In addition, one fucose and one galactose may be acetylated to varying degrees, and the terminal galactose residue is modified. The repeat units are connected by a linkage between the first and third residues, with the remaining three residues forming a side chain |CITS: [4311825][4902692]|. Differences are found in the modifications of the terminal galactose residue, which was found to contain a 4,6-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-ethylidene group, or a 4,6-methylene group in different strains |CITS: [4941627]|. The structure shown here was published in 2007, correcting several errors in earlier reports |CITS: [17227761]|. While colanic acid was considered exclusively an exopolysaccharide that is only loosely associated with the cell surface, the 2007 study also found that colanic acid can be attached to the lipid A core of lipopolysaccharide instead of the O antigen, forming a novel type of lipopolysaccharide which was named |FRAME: 
/CPD0-1101 M<sub>LPS</sub>| |CITS: [17227761]|.

COMMENT - Alginate is a major component of the cell walls of |FRAME: TAX-2870| (brown algae), and can make up to 20 to 30% of the total algal material. It is a linear polysaccharide of (1-4)-linked |FRAME: CPD-15205|, with variable amounts of its C-5 epimer |FRAME: CPD-15204| |CITS: [Schmidt26]|. Alginate can absorb 200300 times its own weight in water, forming a viscous gum.
/
/Algal alginate is not acetylated. Bacteria that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-286| and |FRAME: TAX-352| genera produce an acetylated form of alginate. The biological function of alginates differs between the two genera. In |FRAME: TAX-286| alginate is associated with biofilms, promoting bacterial adherence to target cell walls |CITS: [3155514]|. Alginate production is a major contributing factor in chronic pulmonary infections by |FRAME: TAX-287|, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis |CITS: [3155514]|. In |FRAME: TAX-352| alginate is a structural element in the wall of the cyst, a desiccation-resistant capsule that is formed under adverse environmental conditions |CITS: [16912921]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Levan
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
TYPES - Fructans
COMMON-NAME - a levan
COMMENT - Levan is a non-structural polysaccharide present in several microorganisms and a few plant species. It consists almost solely of fructosyl residues linked via &beta;-2,6 linkages, and is packed into nano-sized spherical forms, giving it a very low intrinsic viscosity. Levan is a main ingredient in natto, a traditional Japanese food.
/
/Plants synthesize levan in the vacuole by the concerted action of various fructosyltransferases such as |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.10|. When acting alone, this enzyme synthesizes linear levan chains from sucrose via the trisaccharide intermediate |FRAME: 6-KESTOSE| (it can also use |FRAME: 1-KESTOTRIOSE| and |FRAME: NEOKESTOSE| as the initial fructose acceptors). Plant fructans generally have a low degree of polymerization (DP <10 to 100). 
/
/The occurrence of levansucrase is widespread in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial levans reach much higher molecular masses and contain up to 10,000 fructosyl units. Species that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-1301|, |FRAME: TAX-1243|, and |FRAME: TAX-1578| genera also contain |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.9|, which forms &beta;-(2,1) fructosyl-fructose linkages. When expressed together with levansucrase, that enzyme creates branching points that connect multiple &beta;-(2,6) linked levan chains, forming a branched polymer known as |FRAME: Graminans graminan| |CITS: [27178733]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinols

COMMON-NAME - a 2-demethylmenaquinol
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

COMMON-NAME - a flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

UNIQUE-ID - ALGINATE
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - alginate
SYNONYMS - (alginate)n
SYNONYMS - alginic acid
SYNONYMS - algin
COMMENT - |FRAME: ALGINATE Alginate| is a major component of the cell walls of |FRAME: TAX-2870| (brown algae), and can make up to 45% of the total algal material. It is a linear polysaccharide of (1-4)-linked |FRAME: CPD-15205|, with variable amounts of its C-5 epimer |FRAME: CPD-15204| |CITS: [Schmidt26]|. The |FRAME: CPD-15205| (M) and |FRAME: CPD-15204| (G) residues are arranged in homopolymeric regions of M and G blocks, interspaced with regions of alternating structure (MG blocks). The physicochemical properties of alginate depend on both the overall M to G ratio and the relative proportions of the three block types in the chain. G block-rich alginate forms a high-strength gel in presence of divalent cations such as calcium, and is found in more rigid parts of the alga. Alginates rich in M or MG blocks are more flexible. The composition varies among species, and within an organism according to the nature and the age of the tissues as well as to the season and to the growing area. Depending on its composition, alginate can absorb 200300 times its own weight in water, forming a viscous gum.
/
/Historically, alginate extracted from seaweed has had a wide variety of uses. Its unique physical properties enable it to be used as a stabilizer, viscosifier, and gelling agent in the food and beverage, paper and printing, biomaterials,
/and pharmaceutical industries |CITS:[9283015][9393029][11018131][12149954][16183570][20581859][25300542]|. Commercial varieties of alginate are extracted from several species, including the giant kelp |FRAME: TAX-35122|, |FRAME: TAX-52969|, and various types of |FRAME: TAX-33637|.
/
/The alginates formed by brown algae are non-acetylated. An acetylated form of alginate is produced by bacteria that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-286| and |FRAME: TAX-352| genera. The higher the degree of O-acetylation, the higher the viscosity and pseudoplastic rheology of the alginate |CITS: [Skjak-Braek88]|. The biological function of alginates differs between the two genera. In |FRAME: TAX-286| alginate is associated with biofilms, promoting bacterial adherence to target cell walls |CITS: [3155514]|. Alginate production is a major contributing factor in chronic pulmonary infections by |FRAME: TAX-287|, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis |CITS: [3155514]|. Most strains of |FRAME: TAX-287| do not produce alginate, although alginate is always produced in the lung of CF pateints. it is believed that alginate encapsulation protects the infecting bacterial cells from phagocytosis, as well as from antibiotic therapy. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-352| alginate is a structural element in the wall of the cyst, a desiccation-resistant capsule that is formed under adverse environmental conditions |CITS: [16912921]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Chitodextrins

COMMON-NAME - a chitodextrin

SYNONYMS - a chitin oligosaccharide
COMMENT - |FRAME: CHITIN Chitin| is a polymer of repeating units of &beta;-(1,4)-linked |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (&beta;-GlcNAc<sub>n</sub>). It may be the second most abundant biopolymer in the world, after cellulose. It is the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans and the insects, the radula of mollusks, and the beaks of cephalopods.
/
/In nature, chitin polymers are likely to have a high degree of polymerization and are insoluble in water |CITS: [20559485]|. |FRAME: Chitodextrins Chitodextrins| are polymers that are still purely composed of &beta;-(1,4)-linked |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| residues, but have smaller degrees of polymerization than native |FRAME: CHITIN chitin|. Though the specific upper limit for defining a chitodextrin is hard to define, a class of related compounds referred to as chitooligosaccharides, composed of both |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| and |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE| typically have a degree of polymerization of 20 or fewer residues |CITS: [20559485]|.
/
/In the structure shown for this compound, R1 will be a hydrogen if the |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue that it is attached to is the terminal residue on the non-reducing end of the compound. R2 will be a hydrogen if the |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue that it is attached to is the terminal residue on the reducing end of the compound. However, R1 and/or R2 may also be a single |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residue or a chain of n |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE GlcNAc| residues.

COMMON-NAME - a chitosan fragment
COMMENT - Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &beta;-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
/Chitosan is found in the cell walls of some phytopathogenic fungi. The natural occuring chitosan has a degree of acetylation between 20-30%, with the acetyl residues grouped into clusters.
/
/Chitosan is mostly produced commercially by deacetylation of |FRAME: CHITIN| , which is the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans.
/The most popular technique for obtaining chitosan is alkaline deacetylation of chitin: this involves boiling chitin in concentrated alkali (50% w/v) for several hours. This process also yields chitosan with a degree of acetylation between 20-30%. However, in such a chitosan, unlike the naturally occurring chitosan, the acetyl groups are uniformly distributed along the polymer chain.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Pectin "Pectin"| is a structural heteropolysaccharide consisting of a complex set of polysaccharides that is present in most primary cell walls and is particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. It s involved in crosslinking cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, which provides rigidity to the cell wall.
/The characteristic structure of pectin is a linear chain of &alpha;-(1-4)-linked |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| that forms the pectin-backbone, |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl|.
/
/Different components of pectin have different substitutions and additions. A common type is |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I "rhamnogalacturonan I"| (RG-I), which makes up 20-35% of pectin. In RG-I some of the |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| units in the backbone are replaced by (1-2)-linked |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, to which side chains of various neutral sugars branch off, mostly |FRAME: D-Galactose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| and |FRAME: XYLOSE|. Another common type is |FRAME: CPD-14581 "rhamnogalacturonan II"| (RG-II), which makes up about 10% of pectin. RG-II is based on a backbone of 8-9 galacturonate units, which are decorated by four side chains consisting of 12 different types of sugars in more than 20 different linkages. RG-II usually forms dimeric structures via the formation of crosslinks by a 1:2 borate diol ester between apiosyl residues in one of the side chains.
/
/Other types of pectin include chains of apiogalacturonan, homogalacturonan, and xylogalacturonan. There is currently no consensus as to how the pectic polysaccharides are linked to each other, or to other polymers, in the wall. However, it is thought that the different peptides are covalently linked to each other via their backbones, forming a large linear structure with many side branches |CITS: [11423143][12162553][Coenen07]|.

COMMON-NAME - a rhamnogalacturonan type II
SYNONYMS - rhamnogalacturonan II
SYNONYMS - RG-II
COMMENT - Rhamnogalacturonan type II (RG-II) is a relatively small polysaccharide that makes up about 10% of |FRAME: Pectin pectin|. Despite its small size, it, is the most structurally complex pectin component. Its &alpha;-1,4-linked D-galacturonate backbone is decorated with four side branches (named AD) consisting of 12 different types of sugars in over 20 different linkages |CITS: [18486536]|. Some of the sugars are quite rare, including |FRAME: CPD-13046|, |FRAME: CPD-20946| (3-C-carboxy-5-deoxy-L-xylose), and |FRAME: CPD-20949| (Dha). RG-II exists in the primary wall as a dimer that is cross linked by a 1:2 borate-diol diester |CITS: [12226238]|. The borate diester cross link is formed between the apiosyl residue in side chain A of each monomer subunit |CITS: [8798473][10224062]|.
/
/Despite this complexity the structure of RG-II is largely conserved across plant species. It has been reported that the structure is virtually the same in members of the Brassicacea, Cucurbitaceae, Leguminoseae, Apiaceae, Liliaceae, Araceae, Amaryllidaceae, Gramineae, and more families |CITS: [12765781]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Porphyrans
TYPES - Red-Alage-Galactans
COMMON-NAME - a porphyran
COMMENT - Porphyran is a sulfated carbohydrate extracted from the cell wall of red seaweeds belonging to the genus |FRAME: TAX-2784| |CITS: [Anderson65]|. Unlike |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| and |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenan|, porphyran is not utilized as ingredient for its gelling or texturizing properties. However, it is one of the most consumed algal polysaccharides because it is the main component of edible |FRAME: TAX-2788| and |FRAME: TAX-2785|, both of which are extensively used in the preparation of sushi |CITS: [Correc11]|.
/
/The backbone of porphyran is composed of about 30% of |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| repeating units (1,3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose followed by 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-&alpha;-L-galactopyranose), with the remaining residues being 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate. The 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate residues can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-13430| by the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.5-RXN "galactose-6-sulfurylase, EC 2.5.1.5"|.
/
/In addition, the galactan backboned is decorated by methyl-ether groups at the C6 position of the 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose residues.
/
/As other sulfated galactans, porphyran may have some potential pharmacological applications |CITS: [18796647]|, based on, for example, its hypolipidemic |CITS: [19202270]| and anti-allergic properties |CITS: [16244430]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Wall-Teichoic-Acids
TYPES - Teichoic-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a wall teichoic acid
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Lipoteichoic-Acids
TYPES - Teichoic-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a lipoteichoic acid
COMMENT - The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.
/
/LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 13 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.
/
/LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness.

There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-75 "poly(glycerol phosphate)"|, while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of |FRAME: CPD-19310 "poly(ribitol phosphate)"| |CITS: [13684313]|. In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages, and are anchored via 2-3 glycerol phosphate units to a <i>N</i>-acetyl-&beta;-D-mannosaminyl-(1&rarr;4)-<i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosamine disaccharide. The glycerol and ribitol units of the polysaccharides are modified with D-alanine esters and/or monosaccharides such as glucose or <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [13684313][4321415]|.
/
/It should be noted that strain 168 also possesses a |FRAME: CPD-19345 "minor form of wall teichoic acid"| that is comprised of poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate) |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/
/Teichoic acids serve several roles in the cell. They serve as reservoirs of phosphates which can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

UNIQUE-ID - 4-Phosphooxy-L-aspartyl-tRNAAsn
TYPES - ASPARTYL-ASX-TRNAS
COMMON-NAME - a 4-phosphooxy-L-aspartyl-[tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-aspartyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562|. The enzymes from yeast and cow are able to attach the acyl group at either the 2'- or the 3'-OH groups |CITS: [17206069]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids
TYPES - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a polyunsaturated fatty acid
SYNONYMS - PUFA
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. |FRAME: Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)"| are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. This class includes many important compounds, such as essential fatty acids and those that give drying oils their characteristic property.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMENT - Natural rubber is an important raw material in an enormous number of products. The backbone of natural rubber comprises a (<i>cis</i>)-1,4-polyisoprene with two or three <i>trans</i>-isoprene units at the &omega;-terminus, formed by the sequential condensation of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) units in <i>cis</i> configuration onto a short <i>all-trans</i> prenyl diphosphate. It is very similar in structure to |FRAME: DOLICHOL dolichols|, but the chain length is much longer (C>1500).
/
/Natural rubber is produced from latex - a material that makes up the cytoplasmic content of the latecifers or latex vessels of |FRAME: TAX-3981| (the Brazilian rubber tree) |CITS: [17545224]|. Although over 2000 plant species capable of producing rubber have been identified, only a few synthesize the high molecular weight rubber that is required for the production of high quality rubber products, and natural rubber is currently produced commercially only from |FRAME: TAX-3981|. A potential alternative source is the Russian rubber-producing dandelion (|FRAME: TAX-333970|), which was cultivated in the former Soviet Union during World War II to satisfy the demand for natural rubber |CITS: [22504822]|.
/
/Rubber biosynthesis is carried out by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.20|. The enzyme is localized at the surface of cytosolic vesicles known as rubber particles, and biosynthesis is initiated through the binding of an allylic pyrophosphate primer, such as |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| |CITS: [Tanaka01][14622254][18799172]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

SYNONYMS - a histo-blood group sialyl Lewis a epitope
COMMENT - The |FRAME: sLea-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis a epitope"| (SLe<sup>a</sup>) was discovered in 1979 with the use of a monoclonal antibody |CITS: [94699]|. While the antigen is believed to play an important role during embryogenesis |CITS: [6381330]|, in adults only low amounts of the antigen are present on normal epithelial cells |CITS: [6751528][6381289]|.
/When the selectin family of adhesion molecules was described, it was found that SLe<sup>a</sup>, along with the |FRAME: sLex-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis x antigen"|, is a ligand for E-selectin.
/
/Higher expression of the SLe<sup>a</sup> antigen in adults is strongly associated with cancer. It was found in high amounts on the surface of human pancreatic, colon and gastric cancer cell lines |CITS: [7142214][6188455]| and in human adenocarcinomas of the colon, stomach, pancreas and gall-bladder |CITS: [94699][6751528][2910493]|.

SYNONYMS - a histo-blood group Le<sup>x</sup> antigen
SYNONYMS - SSEA-1
SYNONYMS - stage-specific embryonic antigen 1
COMMENT - The |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x"| epitope, also known as stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) or CD15 |CITS: [281705]|, is a carbohydrate structure expressed on several glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans of the nervous system and has been implicated in cell-cell recognition, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal migration during development. It appears to be involved in regulating neural stem cells via the Notch signaling pathway |CITS: [22645129]|.
/
/The |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis X epitope"| is formed by &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R|, the disaccharide precursor that can also lead to formation of the |FRAME: Type-2-H-Antigen| by &alpha;(1,2) fucosylation at its terminal galactosyl residue.
/In mice the &alpha;-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase encoded by the |FRAME: HS10520| gene is the main contributor to the production of the |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x"| epitope |CITS: [16973732]|.
/
/The related |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope| is formed by &alpha;(1,4) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R|, which can also lead to formation of |FRAME: Type-1-H-Antigen| by &alpha;(1,2) fucosylation at its terminal galactosyl residue.
/
/Both the |FRAME: CPD-8594| and the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope| cannot be further transformed to ABH-type antigens |CITS: [6156588]|.

TYPES - Lewis-Antigen
COMMON-NAME - a B (Lewis y) histo-blood group epitope
SYNONYMS - a BLe<sup>y</sup> histo-blood group antigen
COMMENT - The Lewis y epitope (Le<sup>y</sup>) is a difucosylated oligosaccharide derived from |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R "type 2 precursor disaccharides"| carried by glycoconjugates on the cell surface. Le<sup>y</sup> is expressed predominately during embryogenesis, and expression on adult tissue is restricted to granulocytes and epithelial surfaces |CITS: [11037972]|, where it acts as a ligand for lectin-like proteins |CITS: [18711002][22101897]|. However, Le<sup>y</sup> is overexpressed in the majority of carcinomas, including breast, ovary, pancreas, prostate, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers, and has been correlated to the pathological staging and prognosis |CITS: [2537068][7714977][8621218][9824007][21512109]|. In these cases, Le<sup>y</sup> occurs either at the plasma membrane as a glycolipid or linked to surface receptors |CITS: [2436750][14871842]|.
/
/Le<sup>y</sup> was shown to play an important role in promoting cell proliferation, tumorigenecity and adhesion |CITS: [21152298][18205178]|, and several clinical trials were conducted using Le<sup>y</sup> monoclonal antibodies for targeted immunotherapy of tumors |CITS: [1327079][8577771][8640770][10829049][10861456][16963623][17545534][17909358][19825951][26026738]|.
/
/The human pathogenic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-210| is known to express the Le<sup>y</sup> antigen in its lipopolysaccharide, mimicking human cell surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [8890213][10096092][11237846][11741906]|.

SYNONYMS - a sialyl Lewis x antigen
SYNONYMS - a histo-blood group sialyl Lewis x antigen
COMMENT - The sialyl Lewis-X (SLeX) antigen is expressed on glycolipids and glycoproteins on the cell surfaces. 
/
/In adults, SLeX antigen is expressed principally on the surfaces of granulocytic cells. It plays an important role during early steps of inflammatory response as a ligand of the three known selectins - E-selectin (also known as endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules, ELAM-1), P-Selectin, and L-selectin, resulting in the capture of leucocytes from the plasma and their attachment to blood endothelial cells |CITS: [2210723][7591266]|. In the case of L-selectin, the antigen needs to be sulfated first, forming |FRAME: 6-Sulfo-sLex-Antigen| |CITS: [9556613]|.
/
/The antigen is expressed in high frequency in tumor tissue where it plays a role in adhesion between tumor cells and blood endothelial cells during tumor metastases |CITS: [6386148][12029441][1699667][1701275]|.
/
/The SLeX antigen is synthesized from |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| by the action of two enzymes, |FRAME: EC-2.4.99.6| and |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.152| |CITS: [1339443][25498912]|.

SYNONYMS - a BLe<sup>b</sup> histo-blood group antigen
COMMENT - The Lewis blood group antigens, discovered in 1946, are biosynthetically and structurally related carbohydrate structures used as markers of cell differentiation and embryonic development, based on fucosylation carried by a number of fucosyltransferases. The system is named after Mrs. H. D. G. Lewis, in whose serum the first member of the family was discovered |CITS: [20995492]|. However, the presence of the Lewis antigens is not limited to erytrocytes, and they are found in different tissues and organs.
/
/One of these fucosyltransferases, encoded by the |FRAME: HS10249| gene, is bifunctional and can fucosylate both the 3 and 4 positions of the penultimate sugar in the precursor disaccharide. The gene, also known as the Lewis gene, has a dominant allele (which was named Le) and a recessive non-functional allele (known as le). The &alpha;(1,4)-fucosyltransferase activity is only relevant when the substrates are derived from the |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharide"|, as that position is already occupied in the |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R "type 2 disaccharide"|.
/
/The first Lewis antigens to be discovered were the |FRAME: Lewis-a-epitope "Lewis a"| and |FRAME: Antigen-Leb "Lewis b"| antigens, which are produced from |FRAME: beta-Gal-13-beta-GlcNac-R "type 1 precursor disaccharides"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7832|). However, the &alpha;(1,3) fucosylation of the <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue of |FRAME: B-Gal-14-NacGlc-R| leads to formation of several related antigens known as the |FRAME: CPD-8594 "Lewis x epitope"| (also known as SSEA-1, for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1), |FRAME: Antigen-Ley "Lewis y epitope"|, and the |FRAME: sLea-Antigen "sialyl-Lewis x epitope"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7831|).

COMMON-NAME - an archaeal dolichyl <i>N</i>-acetyl-&alpha;-D-glucosaminyl phosphate
COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain archaea contain additional saturations |CITS: [9363431][21091511][ 22469971][21745590]|.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C55 dolichol, containing 11 isoprene units, unsaturated at both the &alpha; and &omega; isoprene units, which is typical to some archaea.

TYPES - Branched-chain-fatty-acids
COMMON-NAME - a mycolate
SYNONYMS - a mycolic acid
COMMENT - Mycolic acids are the hallmark of the cell envelope of |FRAME: TAX-1773| and related species and genera. They comprise a homologous series of C60-C90 (2<i>R</i>)-alkyl-(3<i>R</i>)-hydroxy very long-chain fatty acids, and are found as either esters of |FRAME: Arabinogalactan| or as free lipids in the form of trehalose dimycolate (TDM). Both forms contribute to forming the two leaflets of the mycobacterial outer membrane, also called the mycomembrane, which protects the organism from antibiotics and the host's immune system  |CITS: [15653820][17555433][15353567]|.
/
/There is a significant variability in the structure of mycolic acids among different species. Acids from |FRAME: TAX-1716| species contain 22-38 carbon atoms, |FRAME: TAX-697025| and |FRAME: TAX-697025| spp. contain 30-36, |FRAME: TAX-37914| spp. contain 34-38, |FRAME: TAX-1827| spp. contain 34-52 in, |FRAME: TAX-1817| spp. contain 46-60, |FRAME: TAX-2053 <i>Gordonia</i>| spp. contain 46-66, |FRAME: TAX-2060| spp. contain 64-78 , |FRAME: TAX-1763| spp. contain 60-90, and |FRAME: TAX-286801| spp. contain up to 100 carbon atoms |CITS: [24374164]|.
/
/The acids are formed by a Claisen-type condensation of two components - the meromycolic chain and a fatty acid.
/The meromycolic chain of |FRAME: TAX-1773| typically incorporates a hydroxy group at C-1, a cyclopropyl ring fused onto the C-16/C-17 bond (at either a <i>cis</i> or a <i>trans</i> configuration), a methoxyl or oxo group at C-35, and a methyl group at C-36. The modifications and their positions may change among strains and species.
/
/Several structural classes of mycolic acids exist. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the most apolar ones, known as &alpha;-mycolic acids, contain 74-80 carbon atoms (out of which 22-26 carbons are located in the fatty acid moiety and the rest on the mero-chain) and generally two double bonds (that can be in either <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-configuration) or two <i>cis</i>-cyclopropyl groups located in the meromycolic chain. The cyclopropane rings are believed to protect the organism from oxidative stress |CITS: [15653820]|. &alpha;-Mycolic acids usually comprise more than 70 percent of the total mycolic acids in the cell.
/
/Other classes are defined by additional oxygen functions located in the distal part of the meromycolic chain, and include keto-, methoxy-, wax ester-, epoxy-, and hydroxy-types. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the oxygenated mycolic acids (keto-, methoxy-, and hydroxy-types) contain ~84-88 carbon atoms, and are thus four to six carbons longer than the &alpha;-mycolic acids from the same strains.
/
/The biosynthesis of mycolic acids is described in |FRAME: PWYG-321|.

/
/Five types of precursor disaccharides are known to carry ABH activity - type 1 through type 4 and type 6.
/Type 1 precursors are widely expressed on endodermally-derived tissues such as lining epithelia and glandular epithelia. Type 2 precursors are found mainly on ecto- or mesodermally-derived tissues, including erythrocytes |CITS: [Mollicone86]|. Type 3 and 4 precursors are found on ecto- or endodermally-derived tissues, including the salivary glands and kidneys |CITS: [2464874]|.

/
/Both antigens are based entirely on Type 2 (|FRAME: BETA-D-GALACTOSYL-ETCETERA-GLUCOSAMINE "<i>N</i>-acetyllactosamine"|) chains.

/The crucial step in the transition from the i antigen to the I antigen is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.150|, also known as the I-branching enzyme, which introduces the branching by adding a GlcNAc residue by a &beta;(1&rarr;6) linkage to the galactose residue to which other residues are already attached by a 1,3 linkage |CITS: [6490658]|.
/Note that the structure shown here is the core structure that defines I antigenicity. Most i antigens are further glycosylated.

SYNONYMS - an &alpha;-L-fucosyl-1,2-&beta;-D-galactosyl-R
COMMENT - The |FRAME: H-antigen "H antigens"| are fucosylated oligosaccharides that decorate proteins on the surface of red blood cells in people with O blood type. In people with A or B blood types an additional monosaccharide is attached to one of the &beta;-D-galactosyl residues of the H antigen (|FRAME: CPD-12557| in |FRAME: A-antigen "A antigens"| and |FRAME: GALACTOSE| in |FRAME: B-antigen "B antigens"|).
/
/These fucosylated structures are found not only on blood cells but also on many other cell types (mainly epithehal), and it has been suggested that they should be called histo-blood group antigens.
/
/The majority of the A, B and H antigens are linked to the ends of long polylactosamine chains attached mainly to band 3 protein (encoded by SLC4A1), the anion exchange protein of the red blood cells. A minor fraction of the antigens is attached to a ceramide moiety, forming neutral glycosphingolipids.
/
/Several H antigens exist, differing in their core disaccharide |CITS: [2093726]|. The different types are:

/
/Most of the H antigens found in the cell are either type 1 or type 2, followed by type 3 and 4. Type 1 is found in secretions and in the serum, while type 2 is found exclusively on the surface of red blood cells. Type 6 molecules have been described in exocrine secretions.

UNIQUE-ID - D-Tryptophanyl-tRNA-Trp
TYPES - D-aminoacyl-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a D-tryptophanyl-[tRNA<sup>Trp</sup>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA<sup>Trp</sup> molecule misacylated by a D-tryptophanyl group.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I "Rhamnogalacturonan I"| (RG-I) is a polysaccharide that represents about 20-35% of |FRAME: Pectin pectin|. It contains a backbone consisting of repeating &alpha;-(1,2)-|FRAME:L-rhamnose|-&alpha;-(1,4)-|FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| disaccharide units. Between 20 and 80% of the Rha residues are substituted with side chains of various oligosaccharides such as arabinans, galactans, and arabinogalactans. The number and type of side chains are highly variable depending on the species as well as the cell type and developmental stage.
/
/The side chains can consist of individual, linear, or branched |FRAME: CPD-12045| (&alpha;-L-Araf) and |FRAME: GALACTOSE| (&beta;-D-Galp) residues, including &alpha;-1,5-linked L-arabinan with 2- and 3-linked arabinose or arabinan branching, &beta;-1,4-linked D-galactans
/with degrees of polymerization (DP) of up to 47 |CITS: [12162553]|, &beta;-1,4-linked D-galactans with 3-linked L-arabinose or arabinan branching, and &beta;-1,3-linked D-galactan with &beta;-6-linked galactan or arabinogalactan branching (reviewed in references |CITS: [Mohnen02][ONeill03]|. The side chains may also contain &alpha;-L-Fucp, &beta;-D-GlcpA, and 4-O-Me &beta;-D-GlcpA residues |CITS: [ONeill03]|.
/
/The biosynthetic pathway of RG-I is not yet characterized, though some of the enzymes involved have been identified. They include the galacturonosyltransferase GAUT11, the hexosyltransferase of unknown function MUCI70 |CITS: [30228108]|, and the rhamnosyltransferases RRT1-RRT4 |CITS: [32714362]|.

COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan type II
SYNONYMS - type I AG
SYNONYMS - arabino-3,6-galactan
SYNONYMS - type II arabinogalactan
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans |CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AG contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. Larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

SYNONYMS - a linoleoyl-[glycerolipid]
COMMENT - This compound class describes a linoleoyl group that is incorporated within a lipid molecule.
/
/|FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID Linoleate| (linoleic acid) is an &omega;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain and two <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 9 and 12.
/
/Linoleate is produced by many organisms, including bacteria, plants, fungi and some insects. It is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower oils. 
/
/While mammals require linoleate, which is found in their membranes and is used as the precursor for production of |FRAME: CPD-8117|, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID|, |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins|, |FRAME: Leukotrienes leukotrienes|, and |FRAME: Thromboxanes thromboxanes|, they are not able to produce it since they lack |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.6|. Thus linoleate is an essential fatty acid, and must be obtained through the diet.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-18| or |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

SYNONYMS - 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavan-4-one
COMMENT - |FRAME: NARINGENIN-CMPD| is a flavanone that is abundant in citrus fruit, where it mainly occurs as glycosides such as |FRAME: NARINGENIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE| (naringenin-7-glucoside), |FRAME: NARINGIN| (the predominant flavanone in grapefruit), or |FRAME: CPD-7059|. It is also present in tomato.
/
/The naringenin and its glycosides content undergoes significant changes upon phytopathogen attack, and thus it appears that these compounds participate in the defense mechanism of |FRAME:TAX-2706| species and may act as fungicides |CITS: [15053528]|.
/
/|FRAME: NARINGIN Naringin| has been investigated with respect to its ability to scavenge oxygen free radicals involved in the oxidation of hemoglobin |CITS: [12967034]|, lowering the plasma total cholesterol level |CITS: [14738906]| and blocking the cytotoxity and apoptosis of |FRAME: CPD-15099| (Ara-C), a chemotherapeutical drug used for acute leukemia |CITS: [15135655]|.
/
/The bitterness of certain citrus species such as grapefruit (|FRAME:TAX-37656|), bitter orange (|FRAME:TAX-43166|) and pummelo (|FRAME:TAX-37334|) is caused by flavanone neohesperidosides such as naringin, in which a rhamnose is attached via the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose. Flavanone rutinosides such as |FRAME: CPD-7059|, in which the L-rhamnose attached to the C-6 hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety, are tasteless and occur predominantly in sweet citrus fruits such as orange (|FRAME:TAX-2711|) and mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>) |CITS: [15361143]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| (GM) and |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannans| (GGM) are the major hemicellulosic components of the secondary cell walls of softwoods, but occur only in minor amounts in the secondary cell walls of hardwoods. Both polymers consist of a bakbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues. GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues and are often branched.
/Both polymers show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/The mannan backbone of GGM from spruce wood consists of galactose, glucose, and mannose in the mole ratio 1 : 8 : 33, and contains segments of more than four mannopyranose residues, interrupted with a segment composed of both mannopyranose and glucopyranose, or two glucopyranose residues. Branches terminated by single galactose residues are attached at positions 2, 3, and 6 of mannose residues and at positions 3 and 6 of glucose residues of the backbone. Many of the mannose residues are acetylated at positions 2 and 3  |CITS: [11128591]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Galactomannans
TYPES - 1-4-Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactomannan
SYNONYMS - GaM
COMMENT - Mannans are polymers composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked |FRAME: MANNOSE| residues. Pure mannans are rarely found, and most contain &alpha;(1,6)-linked galactopyranosyl side chains.
/
/The extent of galactosylation varies greatly, and the mannose : galactose ratio is one of the main characteristics of the polymer as it determines their physicochemical properties, such as solubility in water, density, and the viscosity of the solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. On one hand, slightly galactosylated linear mannans (about 4% galactose), have been isolated from the seed endosperm of vegetable ivory nut (|FRAME: TAX-115507|) and date (|FRAME: TAX-42345|). They are water-insoluble, resemble cellulose in conformation of the individual molecular chains, and occur in cellulose microfibrils of the plant tissues |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/On the other hand, heavily galactosylated polymers (up to 96%) are abundant in the cell walls of storage tissues (endosperm, cotyledons, perisperm) of many seeds. Those from the endosperm of some leguminous seeds, such as guar (|FRAME: TAX-3832|), locust bean or carob (|FRAME: TAX-20340|), and tara gum (|FRAME: TAX-191904|), are widely used commercially |CITS: [Reid95]|.
/
/Another important feature is the distribution of the galactopyranose residues along the mannan backbone, which affects the molecular interactions of the chains among themselves (self-association) and with other polysaccharides (cooperative associations) in solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

/
/Low-molecular-weight GMs, acetylated at position 2 or 3 of some mannopyranose residues, were isolated from aspen and birch wood |CITS: [12668108]|.

TYPES - Plant-Arabinogalactans
COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan-[protein]
SYNONYMS - a plant [protein]-arabinogalactan
COMMENT - Plant arabinogalactan-proteins belong to a large family of wall glycoproteins/proteoglycans, known as the Pro/Hyp-rich glycoproteins. They are found on the plasma membrane, in the wall, in the apoplastic space, and in secretions.
/
/The glycan moiety of these glycoproteins constitutes 90% to 98% of the weight. It usually consists of branched type II arabino-3,6-galactans, primarily <i>O</i>-linked to Hyp residues |CITS: [20388666]|.
/
/In general, the glycan moieties of plant arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) demonstrate a great structural and compositional variability. The structure shown here is based on a representative Hyp-AG polysaccharide (AHP-1) released by base hydrolysis from a synthetic AGP (Ala-Hyp)<sub>51</sub> from tobacco BY2 cells |CITS: [14724279]|.

COMMENT - Arabinogalactans (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Monounsaturated-fatty-acids
TYPES - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a monounsaturated fatty acid
SYNONYMS - PUFA
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

SYNONYMS - type I LTA
COMMENT - The teichoic acids are found in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. They include a diverse family of cell surface glycopolymers containing up to 60 phosphodiester-linked repeat units. There are two main types: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall. Five types of lipoteichoic acids |CITS: [24819367]| and four types of wall teichoic acids |CITS: [24024634]| have been described so far.
/
/LTAs have been grouped into different types (type I through V) based on their chemical structures. Type I LTA is found in a large range of Firmicutes. It has an unbranched 13 linked glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone, and is usually linked to the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid anchor. The hydroxyl groups at the C-2 position of the GroP repeating units are modified with D-alanyl or glycosyl groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that not all type I LTAs are glycosylated, and variations in the type of sugar exist. For example, some |FRAME: TAX-1386 Bacillus| strains lack glycosyl groups, some contain |FRAME: CPD-12541|, and some contain |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [3733670][2914853]|. The LTA of all |FRAME: TAX-1639| strains investigated to date is glycosylated with |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| |CITS: [6415040][3093460]|, and the LTA of |FRAME: TAX-1280| strain H is glycosylated with |FRAME: CPD-12541| |CITS: [6268617]|.
/
/LTAs can be very abundant. In |FRAME: TAX-1280| every ninth lipid on the outer leaflet of the membrane is an LTA molecule, and the average length is 25 GroP units |CITS: [6697992]|. Although the exact role of LTA is unknown, mutants display significant growth and physiological defects. Teichoic acids are proposed to serve as reservoirs of phosphates that can be mobilized when phosphate becomes limiting |CITS: [104966]|. Being anionic, they are scavengers of cations (in particular Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and may create a pH gradient across the wall by sequestering the protons expelled through the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8396121]|. In addition, lipoteichoic acids are the main source of the hydrophobicity of the cell envelope |CITS: [6337099]|, and may contribute to its adhesiveness. Teichoic acids are also immunogenic, and can be considered the Gram-positive equivalent of the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides |CITS: [46620]|.

/
/Both polymers share a common cytoplasmic pathway of precursor synthesis, and differ only in the last step, during which the polymer is transferred from the undecaprenyl diphosphate membrane anchor that was used during biosynthesis to either peptidoglycan or to |FRAME: 12-DIACYL-3-O-ALPHA-D-GLUCOPYRANOSYL| (Glc-DAG) glycolipid embedded in the external leaf of the membrane.
/

COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/

TYPES - Teichoic-Acid
COMMON-NAME - polyisoprenyl-wall teichoic acid (<i>B. subtilis</i> W23)

SYNONYMS - [(4-D-Ala)-(2-Glc)-Rib-ol]<sub>n</sub>-Rib-ol-P-Gro-P-ManNAc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol
COMMENT - Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as "contaminants" in bacterial extracts from |FRAME: TAX-1590| |CITS: [2662967]|. As they make up a significant portion of the cell walls (about 60% in |FRAME: TAX-1423|) |CITS: [13684313]|, they were named based on the Greek word teikhos, which means a fortification wall.
/
/The teichoic acids are found in the cell walls of a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [5411858][2496299]|. There are two main types of teichoic acids: the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the plasma membrane and extend from the cell surface into the peptidoglycan layer |CITS: [406922]|, and the wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to peptidoglycan and extend through and beyond the cell wall.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly(glycerol phosphate), while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety is a polymer of poly(ribitol phosphate) |CITS: [13684313]|.

Bisecting residues are added by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.144|.
/
/The rest of the name is derived from having one <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residues attached by a &beta;1-2 linkage to the &alpha;-Man-(1&rarr;6) arm of the three mannose core, and one <i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl residue attached by a &beta;1-2 linkage to the &alpha;-Man-(1&rarr;3) arm |CITS: [24178944]|.

COMMENT - <i>O</i>-Linked glycans are polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that are linked to a protein via the oxygen atom in the side chain of an |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| residue.
/Most commonly <i>O</i>-glycosylation begins with the attachment of |FRAME: CPD-3604| to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known. In eukaryotes, <i>O</i>-linked glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus one sugar at a time, while attached to the core protein.
/
/Mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked |FRAME: CPD-3604|, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals. Eight core-type structures of mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycans have been proposed, including |FRAME: Core1 "core 1"|, |FRAME: Core2 "core 2"|, |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINYL-13-N-ETCETERA-GALACTOSAMINY "core 3"|, |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINYL-16-ETCETERA-GALACTOSAMINYL- "core 4"|, |FRAME: Core5 "core 5"|, |FRAME: Core6 "core 6"|, |FRAME: Core7 "core 7"| and |FRAME: Core8 "core 8"| |CITS: [16413314]|.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/PI5P represents only 0.5% of the PI pool present in most cells. However, its levels strongly fluctuate due to external stimuli such as TCR activation, insulin treatment, oxidative stress, and pathogen cellular invasion |CITS: [28302928]|.
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

/However, GAX-type polymers consist of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan| backbone that contains about ten times more &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose side chains than glucuronate ones, while AGX-type polymers are |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans| with a small proportion of the xylopyranose residues of the backbone disubstituted by two &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose residues |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Another difference is that GAX contain some xylopyranose units that are doubly substituted by both 4-<i>O</i>-methylglucuronate and &alpha;-L-arabinofuranose |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. Unlike glucuronoxylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans are not acetylated |CITS: [15944805]|.

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
SYNONYMS - (1,4-&beta;-D-glucosyl)<sub>n</sub>
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

COMMON-NAME - a glycogen
SYNONYMS - a branching glycogen
SYNONYMS - 6-&alpha;-D-(1,4-&alpha;-D-glucano)-glucan
SYNONYMS - glycogen
COMMENT - Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer that serves as a form of energy storage in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch".
/
/Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 7&ndash;10% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.
/
/Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle). Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal value for the particle size above which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. The predicted upper limit is a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter and including about 55,000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without the need for debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.
/
/Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Starch
TYPES - Alpha-6-branched-alpha-14-glucans
COMMON-NAME - starch
COMMENT - Starch is a glucose-based polysaccharide produced by plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Starch combines two polymeric carbohydrates (polysaccharides) called |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-amylose"| and |FRAME: CPD-7043|. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| contains up to several thousand &alpha;-glucosyl units linked almost exclusively in linear &alpha;(1->4) linkages, with very few branches of &alpha;(1->6) linkages. In |FRAME: CPD-7043|, on the other hand, branching is common, and occurs approximately every 24-30 glucose monomer units. Amylopectin is one of (if not the) largest biological polymer known and contains from 10<sup>5</sup>&ndash;10<sup>6</sup> glucose residues |CITS: [9730163]|. Unlike |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| molecules, which is limited to ~55,000 glucose units, the starch branched structure leads to clusters of chains that allow for indefinite growth of the polysaccharide. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| accounts for 30% of starch, while |FRAME: CPD-7043| accounts for the other 70%.
/
/The dense packing of branches at the root of the clusters generates tightly packed glucan chains that are close enough to align and form parallel double helical structures. The helices within a single cluster and neighbouring clusters align and form sections of crystalline structures separated by sections of amorphous material (containing the branches) thereby generating the semi-crystalline nature of amylopectin and of the ensuing starch granule. The crystallized chains become insoluble and typically collapse into a macrogranular solid that is osmotically inert |CITS: [9730163]|. The enzymes of starch synthesis and mobilization are unable to interact directly with the solid structure, with the exception of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.242 "granule-bound starch synthase"| |CITS: [14502990]|.
/
/The solid semi-crystalline starch and hydrosoluble |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| define two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide. Glycogen is by far the most widespread form of storage, as it is found in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. The appearance of semi-crystalline storage polysaccharides appears linked to the requirement of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fuel nitrogenase and protect it from oxygen through respiration of large amounts of stored carbon |CITS: [21220783]|.

The capsular layer is composed of &alpha;-glucan (8090%) and arabinomannan (1020%) polysaccharides, proteins of the ESX-1 secretion system, and small amounts of lipid |CITS: [20221442]|.

However, the polymer differs from classical glycogen in seceral aspects. The chains are shorter, consisting of 7 sugars vs 11. In addition, the branching pattern is different - while there are more &alpha;-1,6 branches than in glycogen (14% vs 9%), less branches are coming off each branch (1.2-1.6 vs 1.8-1.9 in glycogen) |CITS: [27221142]|.

COMMON-NAME - callose
COMMENT - Cell walls of higher plants contain callose, which is a linear homopolysaccharide made up |FRAME: 1-3-beta-D-Glucans| with &beta;-1,6 branches. Callose plays an important role in many processes associated with plant development and in response to environmental stimuli in the form of abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose is also a transitory component of cell plate involved in the formation of new walls during cell division. It is a structural component of plasmodesmatal canals, and is also found in developing cell walls of fibre cells and cotton seed hairs |CITS: [19410266]|.
/
/The main enzyme in callose biosynthesis is callose synthase. The molecular mechanism underlying callose biosynthesis is still poorly understood. Molecular studies have revealed a set of genes in Arabidopsis genome that catalyze and degrade callose |CITS: [19286936]|. 12 glucan synthase like (GSL) genes appear to be involved in male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis |CITS: [18315544]|. Two genes, GSL1 and GSL5, are also known to play a role in pollen development and fertility |CITS: [16021399]|.
/
/Callose is degraded by &beta;-1,3-glucanases |CITS: [11785931]|.
